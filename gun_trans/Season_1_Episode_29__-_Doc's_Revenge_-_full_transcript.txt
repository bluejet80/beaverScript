Title: Gunsmoke (1955â€“1975): Season 1, Episode 29  - Doc's Revenge - full transcript

( dramatic theme playing)
(gunshot)
ANNOUNCER: Gunsmoke...
starring James
Arness as Matt Dillon.
( somber theme playing)
DILLON: Some of these
Boot Hill men lie here
with nothing but a
saddle blanket for a coffin,
and some of them, who are
real poor, without even that.
But they all died the same way:
hard and fast, and
hating something.
It's the hate a man
carries that destroys him.








It's not the bullets.
Hate can twist and sicken
him till he's no good to anybody,
including himself.
And that's a bad thing to watch,
especially when
it's an old friend.
Nope, I sure didn't
hire on for that.
Matt Dillon, U.S. marshal.
( mellow theme playing)
(dog barking)
Oh. Howdy, Doc.
Hello, Chester.
You goin' out,
huh? On a sick call?
I don't usually carry my bag
when I'm going down
to the saloon for a beer.








(chuckles): No, sure.
You got something on your mind?
No, no, I just
thought I'd stop by.
Just wanted to say hello.
Yeah, that's all.
Why don't you walk over
to the livery stable with me?
I got to go out to
Jake Morrison's place.
His boy's got the ague.
Oh, ain't that a shame.
Seems like everybody's getting
the ague these days. Yeah.
I had a touch
myself, last month.
You did? Yeah.
Of course, Dr. Leasterly's
Fever and Ague Killer
fixed me up fine.
It did, huh? Y...
Or some folks swear
by Skood's Calagog.
Hm?
Others like just plain
old sulfur and molasses
and a little hot ginger tea.
Heh. Yeah.
You generally subscribe
quinine, don't you, Doc?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Uh, how's your lumbago, Chester?
Oh, it's fine. Lumbago's fine.
That, uh, August Flowers
Bitters fixed you up, did it?
Well, no, Doc. I
got some new stuff.
Some, uh,
"Curtis's Original
Mamluk Liniment."
You see hear? It's a "garden tea
"to cure cramps,
pains in the joints,
"sore throat, frostbite,
"reptile bite, mange,
salt rheum, dysentery
diarrhea, and choll-era."
That's "cholera."
Oh.
A whole medical arsenal
wrapped up in that
one little bottle, huh?
Heh. Yeah. And
it's doin' you good?
Oh, it is, Doc.
Do you feel fine?
Oh, yeah.
Well, you look terrible.
Uh, then... Oh, well, Doc,
to tell you the truth, I...
I did kind of wake up with a
kind of a grabbing down here
this morning. Oh, pain?
Yeah. It kind of feels like
somebody stuck a
butcher knife in there
and just turned
the handle on me.
Well, so you thought
you'd come to my office
and get a little
free advice, huh?
Well, I...
Well, I'll give you
some advice, Chester.
Oh. I'll give you
some free advice.
Stop puttin' all that salt
pork in your stomach
and those dried beans, and
get some fresh greens in there.
That's what you need.
And stay out of saloons.
It don't hurt that bad.
And what's more important,
throw all that stuff away.
Throw it away. Or better still,
use it to put on your boots.
It's fine for
toughenin' up leather.
(mutters)
( tense theme playing)
What's the matter?
What is it, Doc? You
know them fellas?
Doc.
You look like you're
looking at a ghost. What is it?
Where you goin'?
Doc, where you goin'?
I'm gonna kill a man.
( dramatic theme playing)
Doc, what are you
gonna do with that?
Doc, that...
That old .36 Colt ain't
nothin' to play around with.
That can blow a hole
clean through a man.
Doc. Doc, are you gonna tell me
what you're fixin'
to do with that?
Doc, you don't wanna
do nothin' foolish, now.
Doc.
Doc, you're gonna
get yourself in trouble.
(sighs)
Mr. Dillon!
Mr. Dillon.
What is it, Chester?
You better hurry.
Maybe you can stop him.
Stop who? Doc.
He looks he's
gonna kill somebody.
Doc? Yes, sir.
He's got his .36 Colt,
and he's marchin'
up Front Street
lookin' for somebody.
I-I tried my best to
stop him, Mr. Dillon,
but he wouldn't listen to me.
You should have seen the
look on his face, Mr. Dillon.
He... He means business.
I never seen Doc
like this before.
Well, who's he after?
Well, I don't know.
Do you know what it's all about?
No, sir. But it ain't no
joke to face that .36 Colt,
even if it is an old
ball of percussion.
( suspenseful theme playing)
Marshal! Marshal!
Doc's in there.
And if you don't come outside,
I'm gonna kill you
right where you stand.
No.
I told you. I won't fight you.
That's up to you, Clem,
but I'm gonna kill ya whether
you defend yourself or not.
(gun cocks)
Doc.
Matt, stay out of this.
It happens to be my business
when one man threatens
another man in this town, Doc.
Especially when the other
man won't even defend himself.
That'd be murder, Doc.
I've thought of that,
and I'm gonna kill him.
Why?
I got reasons.
You won't tell me?
No, sir.
What about you?
I could say I don't know.
I could say I don't
even know 'em,
that I'm just a stranger
riding through town.
But I know.
You mean, he's got good reasons?
I guess he thinks so.
Do you?
Not many men would answer
yes to that, would they, marshal?
But you won't defend yourself.
I won't draw on him, no.
If he's gonna shoot me,
he'll have to answer for it.
I'm not a fightin' man,
marshal, I'm a miner.
Me and my partners here
were just riding through.
We don't want any trouble.
He's telling the truth, marshal.
We made our strike
in Arizona territory.
We're headed back to St. Louis.
We was mindin' our own
business, having a quiet drink,
when this madman roars
in here and jumps Clem.
Clem.
Clem Maddow.
This my brother, George,
and our partner, Ben Bartlett.
We don't want no
trouble, marshal.
But we can sure
handle it if it comes.
You men get back to your drinks.
Doc.
I'm gonna kill him,
Matt. You can't stop me.
Oh, I can't, huh? No.
You're taking an awful
lot for granted, Doc.
Maybe you think I
won't throw you in jail
for threatening murder.
Maybe you think because
you're the town's only doctor,
you can get away with anything.
Matthew...
Listen to me. You're
forgetting a few things.
Your position in this town
means that you ought
to be setting an example
instead of running around
acting like some crazy gun hand.
And what's more important,
you have a responsibility.
Some other man's life may be
his own to go out and throw away,
but yours belongs to
this whole town, Doc.
Too many lives depend on you.
Now, you calm down. You
go back and put that gun away.
( tense theme playing)
(Bartlett chuckling)
You sure told him off.
You shut up.
Huh?
I don't know anything
about you, Maddow.
Maybe you're what
you say you are,
just an innocent miner
passing through town.
But if Doc doesn't like you,
that's good enough for me.
Now, you get out of
Dodge and stay out.
Why should we? We
got a right to be here?
And you take this
partner of yours with you.
I don't like him.
All right, marshal.
I understand.
We're gonna ride
on tomorrow anyway.
But we'll move on tonight
as soon as we stock
up on some grub.
All right.
You get your things and move on.
Marshal.
Thanks.
Where did he go, Chester?
Well, probably back to
his office like you told him.
Oh, Mr. Dillon, the
look on his face...
Yeah, I know. I know.
Well, you had to do it.
Yeah.
You better get
back to the office.
Yes, sir.
I won't be long.
Well...
Doc?
Doc.
( suspenseful theme playing)
( peaceful theme playing)
(crickets chirping)
Did you find him?
No, he didn't show up at
Delmonico's for his supper.
It's way past his usual time.
Well, I've been
watching his office,
and his light
didn't come on yet.
Of course, he could
be up there in the dark.
No.
You don't think that maybe
he might have left town?
Run away?
'Cause of what I told him?
Not Doc.
He's too bull-headed.
Most likely, he's
out there somewhere
with that old Colt .36,
looking for Maddow.
Well, I'm afraid you're
right, Mr. Dillon. It...
Doggone it, I don't know what
this town would do without Doc.
He...
He can be awful
irritating and all, but he...
Yeah.
Now, that Clem Maddow.
He didn't seem
like such a bad fella.
No, he didn't.
Him or his brother.
I'd sooner believe bad
about that partner of theirs,
that Bartlett.
He looked like he could be a
hard case without half-trying.
Yeah, maybe, Chester.
Why wouldn't
Maddow defend hisself?
Well, it wasn't 'cause
he was afraid to, Chester.
No. Seemed like he just
didn't wanna fight Doc.
Didn't seem mad at
all. Just kind of sad.
Maybe he's a man with a
guilty conscience, Chester.
Well, that could be.
(gunshot)
( dramatic theme playing)
Marshal.
Marshal!
All right, everybody. Get
back out of the way, here.
It's Clem. I think he's dying.
Shot in the back.
Yeah. Oh, it's awful.
He said he'd kill him.
Now he's gone and done it.
Did you see who did it?
No, I was in the store.
But George was here
and got hit in the head.
You know who it was?
I ain't sure.
I was loading a packhorse.
Had my back
turned. I heard a shot.
Then, when I turned
around, he hit me.
I ain't sure, marshal.
It must have been him.
Anybody else around here see it?
There ain't much
doubt, is there?
Who else would have a reason?
Besides, everybody in town
heard him threaten to kill Clem.
Just because a man's a
doctor don't give him the right
to go around murdering
people. (Clem groans)
He's not dead yet, Bartlett.
So the important thing now is
to try and save his life, isn't it?
So maybe you better just shut
up and give us a hand with him.
Where will we take
him, Mr. Dillon?
There's only one place, Chester.
Hey, marshal, it's him.
Where you been, Doc?
Well, I was down at
the stable. I heard a shot.
It's Maddow. He's
been shot in the back.
As if he didn't know.
Now, look, Doc.
I can understand you shootin'
a man if you had a reason.
But... not in the back.
Marshal, ain't you gonna
do anything about him?
Now look, this partner of
yours may be bleeding to death,
and he's gonna die if
he doesn't get attention.
And this is the
only doctor in town.
Well, Doc?
Gonna let him die?
( tense theme playing)
Bring him up to the office.
All right. You boys
get his hands, will ya?
Now, lift him easy.
Careful. Careful.
All right.
How's your head?
My head's all right.
It's Clem I'm worried about.
That doctor tried
to kill him once,
there ain't no reason he
wouldn't finish him off now.
Marshal says he's the
only one around here.
That right?
Yeah. He's the only
one for 30 miles.
I still say we ought
to get him out of here.
We could carry him that far.
Ben, you know he
never would make it.
(sighs)
Where you going?
Check the horses. What for?
There's a lot of money sitting
down there in them saddlebags.
Yeah, well, maybe
I better go with you.
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?
I'm gettin' so I don't trust
nobody around here anymore.
Is he gonna pull through?
I don't know.
I've done all I can.
Well, good.
Then you won't have anything
on your conscience, anyway.
Well, you didn't have to
stand here and watch me.
I know I didn't.
That's not why I came, Doc.
I wanted this. Why?
'Cause I know you
didn't shoot him, Doc,
but I had to be
able to prove it.
How'd you know?
'Cause he was shot in the back.
I tried to tell you
that out there,
but you didn't
seem to understand.
Well, thanks, Matt, but that's
not very much proof for a court.
No, but this is.
This .45 caliber bullet
couldn't very well have come
from your old Colt
.36, now, could it?
No, it couldn't, but...
Well, who did shoot him?
I'm the only one in town
that had any reason to.
I'm the only one in
town that even knew him.
Except his partners.
A man could fatten his
take in a mining strike
by shootin' one of his
partners in the back, Doc.
Let's try something.
How is he, marshal?
I think he's gonna be all right.
He ain't gonna die?
That's mighty fine.
Yeah, we were plenty worried.
What with him operating and all.
You didn't have to worry.
He's a doctor above
everything else.
He's a good one too.
Besides...
this bullet, it didn't
come from Doc's gun.
( suspenseful theme playing)
Well, who did shoot him?
Don't you know?
Don't either of you know?
What do you mean?
You're talking crazy. Am I?
Just keep your hand
away from that gun, Bartlett.
You think I shot him, don't you?
Well, I didn't. I was in that
store when that shot was fired.
You can ask the
storekeep. I did ask him.
What did he say?
He said he thought
you were there.
He couldn't be sure,
but he thought so.
He didn't say where you were.
Why, you must be
out of your mind.
You think I'd shoot
my own brother,
hit myself over the head?
Maybe.
Oh, could I?
Ben, I'm asking
you. My own brother.
Maybe.
No, you don't think I could.
You know I didn't.
Because you did it, Ben.
Just stay right there.
You can't prove
a thing, marshal.
Now, I'm leaving here,
and nobody better follow me.
Drop it.
Did you ever see what one of
these things will do to a man?
Drop it!
Hey, you took a chance, Doc. No.
Anybody who'd shoot
his own brother in the back
is too much of a coward to
fight anybody face to face.
Just try me.
Why, you... (grunts)
Ain't no law says a man
got to love his brother.
All right, you get.
Chester. Yes, sir.
Pulse is better.
Color's better too.
Funny thing.
What, Doc?
I don't hate him anymore.
I'm glad to hear that.
Well, it was what
you said in the bar
that made me come to my senses.
Yeah. You know, I looked
all over for you afterwards.
You gave me kind of a
scare when I couldn't find you.
Well, I remembered I had to
go out to Jake Morrison's house.
His boy had the ague.
Doc?
Uh, yes, Clem?
You take it easy, now.
You're gonna be all right.
Doc?
I wanted to tell you.
I loved her.
I would've come back if I could.
I didn't turn out to be much.
Ellen deserved better.
(breathing heavily)
I guess I never
even thought of that.
You get some sleep now, Clem.
Things are gonna
look better tomorrow.
For both of us.
Who was Ellen, Doc?
Doesn't matter now,
Matt. It's not important.
Well, it must have
been important.
Who was she?
Well, I never did talk
about it before. Never did.
But I don't mind telling you.
Happened a long time ago.
I was in love with Ellen.
She loved him.
He went away and
never did come back.
Their baby died at
birth. It shamed her.
Broke her heart.
She died soon after that.
I carried a hate in my
heart for him all these years.
Well, that's just
not good for a man.
No.
No, it isn't.
I'm sorry, Doc.
It's passed, Matt.
It's forgotten.
Sure.
Well...
good night, Doc.
( melancholy theme playing)
Good night, Matt.
( mellow theme playing)
