Leave It To Beaver.
Starring Barbara Billingsley,
Hugh Beaumont, Tony Dow...
and Jerry Mathers as the Beaver.
What are you looking for?
Comics.








I promised Wally and the Beaver
I'd save them for them.
Well, don't muss 'em up.
I haven't seen them yet.
I'll read them to you later.
You know, those boys have
only been gone for three days.
It seems like weeks.
The first couple of days,
the silence around here
was overwhelming.
It was nice of Aunt Martha
to invite them up to Riverside.
Hope they're not
giving her any trouble.
I don't think they are.
Before they left,
I made them promise that,
all the time they were there,
they absolutely would not behave
like they do around here.
Well, uh,you know what I mean.
Hope Aunt Martha's
enjoying their visit.
Nothing harder to understand
than someone else's children.
Yeah, especially when you've
never had any of your own.
[Chuckles]
[Rings]








Hello?
Oh, hello, Aunt Martha.
Oh, I've had the most charming
visit with the boys.
Well, there was a little discussion
last night about washing our feet.
But otherwise, everything
has gone just wonderfully.
Oh, that's fine, Aunt Martha.
What train are the boys taking?
Ward and I wanna meet them.
[Mouthing Words]
I'm putting them on the 1 0:05.
Oh, I'd better go.
And thanks so much
for letting me have them, dear.
Well, you're welcome, Aunt Martha.
Ward wants to speak to you.
Hello. Aunt Martha?
Listen, would you tell the boys
a couple of things for me?
Certainly, Ward.
Of course I will.
Yes, Ward, I'll tell them.
And by the way, Ward.
I bought Theodore
some warm undershirts.
He was wheezing at night.
Well, thank you, Aunt Martha.
Yes, we'll be there
to meet them.
Good—bye.
She bought them
some undershirts.
Oh?
Well, I've just talked
to your mother and father.
Your father tells me
this is your first trip,
and he expects you
to behave on the train.
Yes, Aunt Martha.
Aunt Martha, do we have
to wear these tags
all the way home?
Why, of course, Theodore.
Suppose you and Wallace got lost?
That's your identification.
Why, my two brothers
always wore tags like that
when they went visiting.
Gee, Aunt Martha,
weren't they embarrassed?
Embarrassed?
Dear me, no.
They were Bronsons.
—Oh,yeah.
— Hmm.
Now, I'll buy your tickets and see
that you get on the right train.
Gee, Aunt Martha,
couldn't we get our own tickets
and get on the train by ourselves?
Yeah. Dad let us buy our own tickets
comin' up here.
Oh, I see.
You boys are so grown up,
you don't want a fussy old aunt
putting you on the train.
Oh, we don't mind you being fussy.
Uh, I mean, we can
do things by ourselves.
Couldn't we buy our own tickets?
Huh, Aunt Martha?
Well, your train does leave
in a few minutes just over there
on Track number 5.
I suppose we could
say good—bye here.
thank you, Aunt Martha.
Good—bye.
Wallace.
Theodore.
Good—bye, Aunt Martha.
Good—bye.
And remember,
don't talk to any strangers.
[Man On RA.]
Mrs. R.G. Castle, please
go to the stationmaster’s office.
Your little boy has been located
Wally, couldn't we
take these tags off?
Oh, maybe Aunt Martha
wouldn't like it.
We can always put 'em back on
in case we get lost.
June, I just called the station.
The boys' train will be leaving
Riverside about 45 minutes late.
Oh. You suppose
they'll be all right?
Sure, they'll be all right.
What are you doing?
Making raisin—nut cookies.
Well, uh,
why all the equipment?
Well, I like them with raisins and nuts,
and you like them without nuts.
Wally likes them without raisins,
and the Beaver likes 'em without anything.
Sol figured it was easier
to make four batches...
than to have everybody
dig the stuff out later.
Hmm. All this time,
I thought we were
one big, happy family.
If there's gonna be a delay,
I'm glad Aunt Martha's with the boys.
I hope they don't get bored
waiting in the station.
Oh, June.
How could two normal boys
get bored in a railroad station?
All kinds of fascinating
things to do.
When I was a kid,
I used to go down just
to watch people run for trains.
[Chuckles]
Sometimes, if you were lucky,
one of their suitcases
would fly open.
That doesn't sound so interesting.
Or you could always
watch a fat lady hit a kid.
Why would they do that?
I don't know.
But I've never been
in a railroad station yet...
where there wasn't
a fat lady hitting a kid.
Oh, Ward.
You're making all this up.
[Chuckles]
Erwin, I've told you four times—
Don't disappear when the train's
about to leave.
Look at you.
Where's your cap?
I left it in there.
It's too late now.
We're just going to have
to leave without it.
Every time we go someplace,
I tell you the same thing
over and over again.
[Scolding Continues, Indistinct]
Wally, why was that lady yelling
at that little boy like that?
I don't know. Grown—ups
always gotta get excited
when they're goin' somewhere.
[Yawns]
— What should we do now, get our tickets?
— Nah. We got a lot of time yet.
[Foot Rests]
[Foot Rests]
Wanna get another soda?
I don't think so.
The last one gave me the burps.
It's a nice big room for it though.
Well, I thinkl'll get us
a couple more candy bars
out of the machine.
You watch the bags.
Okay.
Remember what Aunt Martha said,
don't talk to any strangers.
[Man On RA.]
Your attention, please.
Redcap number 37.
Redcap number 37.
Please report to the Po we/son Room.
Mister, are you a stranger?
Not me, sonny.
I've lived here all my life.
Oh. What time is it?
Quarter of] 1:00.
— thank you, mister.
— Say, why did you ask
If I was a stranger?
I just wanted to make sure,
'cause I'm not supposed to
talk to any strangers.
[Mouthing Word]
Wally, I thunk you was
gonna get two candy bars.
I was, but I lost one of the dimes.
— Was it your dime or mine?
— Yours.
— Oh.
— That's all right.
I'll let you have
some of mine.
After we finish your candy bar,
let's go watch the man at the gate
punch tickets.
Beaver, you sure get a lot of fun
outta doin' nothin'.
Come on.
It's a quarter of] 1:00.
Yeah.
That was a very wise decision,
Aunt Martha.
Yeah. All right. Bye.
Well, got the first batch
of cookies in the oven.
Yeah.
Anything wrong?
Oh, no. No, uh—
Well, Aunt Martha left the boys
at the station by themselves.
She was a little worried about it.
Well, come to think about it,
so am I.
Now, why would she leave
those boys at the station
by themselves?
I don't know why she'd leave 'em there,
but there's nothing to worry about.
Nothing to worry about?
When I was Wally's age, I went
all the way to Chicago by myself.
They're two young boys.
And I didn't even own an undershirt.
Just because you were a—
a hoodlum when you were young...
is no reason to have my babies
traveling around the countryside
like a couple of gypsies.
Uh— Why don't we go and put
the raisins in your cookies, huh?
Don't be so messy, Beaver.
Lick the mustard off your fingers.
Yes, boys?
We want two tickets to Mayfield.
I'm a full fare,
and he's a half one.
Mm—hmm.
Uh, that'll be 4.86.
There you are.
Uh—
Uh, well, we'd better
come back later, mister.
What's the matter, Wally?
We spent too much
on sandwiches and stuff.
We don't got enough money.
What are we gonna do?
Wait a minute.
Hey, mister.
How far can me and my brother
get towards Mayfield for $1.20?
Mm, Bellport.
That's the first stop.
Okay, mister, we'll take 'em.
A few minutes ago,
you boys were asking about Mayfield.
Are you kids sure you know
what you're doing?
Oh, sure, mister.
Okay.
There you are.
thank you.
Wally.
Instead of buying the tickets
to Bellport,
shouldn't we call Mom or Dad
or Aunt Martha?
Well, suppose we would've called
and nobody would've been home...
and we lost our money
in the phone.
We wouldn't even have had
enough money to get to Bellport.
You know, Wally, maybe
when we get on the train,
some nice old rich man
will give us a bagful of money.
Beaver, you're silly.
Anyways, stuff like that
only happens a long time ago.
Hey, you put raisins and nuts
in all of these.
I know. At the last minute,
I asserted my independence,
and I put everything in everybody's.
Oh, they're not bad.
What's all this?
While the boys have been away,
I've been cleaning up their room.
I wanna throw this junk away
before the boys get back.
Hey. That looks like
a pretty good sports jacket.
Not anymore— one sleeve.
Now, how could that
have happened?
I don't know.
Wally came home
from dancing school like that once.
Well, they must be getting
some pretty aggressive
little girls over there.
Did he say how it happened?
Not a word.
As a matter of fact,
he seemed surprised
when I pointed it out to him.
Well, it seems kind of a shame
to throw it away.
[Sighs]
Honey?
Isn't it time
to leave for the station yet?
Relax, June. I told you
the boys' train was 45 minutes late.
They're just about going
through Bellport now.
[Horn Blowing]
Tickets.
Wally, the conductor's
comin' this way.
Is he collectin' tickets?
He sure is.
What do you think he'll do to us,
throw us off the train?
Nah. They only do that in movies.
Tickets. Tickets.
Boys, these are for Bellport.
You rode past your stop.
Well, we couldn't get off, mister.
There was this fat man in the aisle.
Well, I wish you'd have said something.
I'd have seen that you got off.
Now we'll have to find a way
to get you back there.
Don't bother, mister.
We don't know anybody
in Bellport anyways.
Uh, well, you see, mister,
we're goin' to Mayfield.
Then why did you buy tickets
for Bellport?
Because we only had
that far money.
Well, boys, I'm sorry, but you can't
ride to Mayfield without tickets.
We gotta get there, mister.
We're comin' back from
visitin' our Aunt Martha.
Well, didn't she give you money
for the tickets?
Well, not 'xactly.
She doesn't have enough to eat.
— She lives in the poorhouse.
— [Passengers Chuckling]
We was visiting her.
You have relatives in Mayfield?
Oh, no, sir.
Just our mother and father.
Couldn't they have sent you
the money for the tickets?
Well, they could've,
but our father's in the hospital.
Oh, that's a shame.
Just what's wrong with him?
I think he fell out of an airplane.
Didn't he, Wally?
— Uh, well—
— Well, did he, son?
Well, I guess so, but he's been
kind of unconscious.
He couldn't tell us much about it.
Now, boys, you don't really expect me
to believe all this, do you?
Mm, no, sir. He just said that
'cause he thought you were
gonna throw him off the train.
Yeah. We spent all our money
On junk— at the station.
I think we can figure a way
out of this.
I'll take care of it myself.
I'm, uh, going to give you
my address.
And you give it
to your parents...
and uh, have them send me
the money.
Gee, thanks, mister.
We'll sure send it.
—I know you will, boys.
—thank you, sir.
Fellas, when you got on the train,
you didn't really think you were going
to ride all the way to Mayfield
for nothing, did you?
Oh, no, sir.
No, sir. We thunk some nice
old rich man would give us
a bagful of money.
He's always thinkin'
things like that, mister.
He's just a kid.
Yeah, I'm just a kid.
Tickets.
[No Audible Dialogue]
You know somethin', Wally?
What, Beave?
I wish Aunt Martha
did live in a poorhouse.
I never seen one.
Here. Look at the pictures.
Boys, how's it feel
to be home?
Oh, great, Dad.
This house seems to have gotten
smaller since we went away.
[Chuckling]
Well, maybe
you've gotten bigger.
Boys, I want you
to unpack your bags right away.
I wanna put your dirty clothes
in the laundry.
We don't have no dirty clothes.
But, boys, I packed
all those clean clothes.
Didn't you even
change your socks?
Uh—uh.
We washed our feet instead.
Yeah, Aunt Martha made us.
Yes, we heard
something about that.
Well, come on, Beave.
Hey, fellas, wait a minute.
You haven't even told us.
How was the train trip?
Yes. We're anxious
to hear all about it.
This is the first time you've
had a trip by yourselves.
Uh, you know how train trips are.
You get on at one station,
and you get off at another.
And in between, you look out
at cows and stuff.
Come on, Beave.
Ward, they have spent
four days with Aunt Martha.
[Door Closes]
They've had a long train trip
by themselves for the first time.
Why don't they tell us about it?
Well, kids don't feel that their parents
are really interested in what they do.
They think, when we ask them questions,
we're just trying to find something
to criticize them for.
Hey, Beave.
Where's that starfish
we got on the beach?
We gotta put it in some kind of junk
to keep it from getting rotten.
I put it between the shirts
so the arms wouldn't get busted.
Good idea.
— Is that the paper
the conductor gave you?
— Yeah.
When are we gonna
give that to Dad?
Well, you know, Beave,
I've been thinkin'.
Maybe we could
save our allowance
for a couple of weeks...
and give the conductor
the money ourselves.
Yeah.
We could use the money
I was savin' for a new fishing reel.
We could use the 50 cents
Mrs. Donaldson gave me
for catching her parakeet.
[Doorbell Rings]
Hi, Ward.
Hello, George.
[June]
Who is it, dear?
It's George Haskell, dear.
Go on in, George.
Agnes asked me to bring this over.
This is June's knitting.
The girls are, uh, making an afghan
for the bazaar.
It's sort of a community project,
and this is June's week to knit.
Oh, uh— Well, it's nice of you
to drop it by.
Yeah. Uh, Ward,
is it all right if I put it down?
They've been workin' on it
for three weeks, and it's kinda heavy.
Oh, sure, sure.
I'm sorry.
I sure got a kick
outta your kids today.
Oh, Wally and the Beaver?
Huh?
Oh, yes, yes. On the train
on the way in from the city.
Oh, they were a scream.
I suppose they told you
all about it.
All about what?
About how they didn't have
tickets for the train.
They— The—
Oh, uh, sit down, George.
Sure.
Uh, no tickets, huh?
No. No tickets.
Boy, I certainly had to admire
their ingenuity.
The story they gave
that conductor was great—
all about how they'd been visiting
an aunt who lives in a poorhouse,
and then they had to come back
and see you in the hospital
[Laughing]
June oughta know about this.
— June.
— George, uh—
Uh—
[Clears Throat]
It was my idea in the first place
that the boys take this trip,
and I'd just as soon June didn't
hear about it right now.
Oh.
[Hushed]
I-I get ya.
At my house, I always say what
Agnes doesn't know won't hurt me.
Oh, no. It's nothing like that.
It's, uh—
Well, it's something like that.
Well, hello, George.
Did you call me?
Yeah. I, uh,
brought the afghan over.
Oh.
Yeah.
[Clears Throat]
Well, I, uh—I think
I left the water running.
Uh-huh.
Ward, those kids of yours
were really something.
[Laughing]
They—They had half that train
in stitches.
And that little Gopher of yours—
[Laughing]
Uh—
Do you know how you wound up
in the hospital?
[Laughing]
You fell out of an airplane.
[Laughing]
[Chuckles]
[Both Laughing]
We'll get a stamp and mail this
to the conductor tomorrow.
You know, Wally,
I'm sure glad this day is over.
Yeah, me too.
Listen, Beaver, why'd you have
to tell the conductor that crazy story?
You could've got us in big trouble.
I know, but I was scared.
Anyway, while I was tellin' it,
I almost believed it was true.
Hi, fellas.
[WE/M
0h, hi, Dad
Your father and I
came up to say good night.
You kids all washed up?
All except our feet.
We done that at Aunt Martha's.
I know.
Um, sure good
to have you fellas back.
Sure good to be back, Dad.
I want you boys
to go right to sleep, all right?
Okay, Mom.
Good night.
Good night, Mom.
Good night.
Good night, Dad.
Say, by the way, fellas, what are
you gonna do about that little matter
you have to take care of?
You know, between you
and the train conductor.
Uh—
Well, we're gonna mail it to him
tomorrow, Dad.
Oh, fine. Fine.
That's a pretty nice poorhouse
Aunt Martha lives in, isn't it?
It sure is.
Well, good night.
[Wally]
Goodnight, Dad
Oh, uh, boys, by the way,
you'll be glad to learn
I'm fully recovered.
— Recovered?
— Yeah, from that nasty fall
I took out of the airplane.
— Well, good night.
— Good night, Dad.
What are you talking about?
Never mind,June.
How do you suppose
they found out?
I don't know.
Sometimes he finds out stuff
you know he couldn't find out.
It sure is spooky.
You know, Wally, maybe
it's the same way “Santy” Claus
finds out about stuff.
Santy Claus?
Beaver, don't you know—
Uh, we'd better get to bed.
Oh,June. I was reading
“Letters to the Editor.”
I want to know
what this is all about.
Now, all that business
with the conductor...
and Aunt Martha
living in a poorhouse...
and you falling out
of an airplane.
Those boys get in any trouble
on that train?
June, the boys had a nice visit
with Aunt Martha.
They got on the train
and came home.
Now they're upstairs
safe and sound in their own beds.
Now, doesn't all that satisfy
your instincts as a mother?
It doesn't satisfy my instincts
as a woman.
I wanna know
what happened.
Oh.
Well, uh, why don't you ask
George Haskell to tell you
all about it when—
Oh, no, you don't.
You're gonna tell me
and right now.
June, are you threatening me?
Yes, I am.
Well, in that case—
Uh, here, you'd better get
a firm grip on your afghan.
