Title: Leave It to Beaver (1957–1963): Season 1, Episode 29  - Tenting Tonight - full transcript

Boy, it's gonna be real neat,
huh, Beaver?
Fishin' and campin'
and messin' around up in the woods.
Yeah.
We might even find an owl
asleep in a tree and bring it home.
Why would you wanna
bring home an owl?
I don't know.
I'd be the only kid on the block
with a real, live owl.
Well, if we're lucky,
we might find an owl.
I sure wish the weekend
would get here.
[Announcer]
Leave It To Beaver.
Starring Barbara Billingsley,
Hugh Beaumont, Tony Dow...








and Jerry Mathers as the Beaver.
Hi, dear.
Have a good game?
How could you help having
a good game on a day like this?
Why, the air was so clear,
you could see for miles.
Good. Then you didn't lose
any golf balls.
Only three. Where are the boys?
Must be outside somewhere.
Kids couldn't resist taking advantage
Of a day like this.
They're taking advantage
of a double feature
at a cartoon parade.
Movies on a day like this?
I drove them down at noon,
and I said you'd pick them up at 6:00.
[Clicks Tongue]
You know, somewhere back in history,
it's rumored that the Cleavers
were related to Johnny Appleseed.
These two characters of ours
can't even walk back and forth to the movies.
Eddie and Chester and Tooey
are with 'em.
You're gonna have
to drop them off too.
Oh, great.








Hi, Dad.
I came out to see if you were here.
Well, I've been here for i 0 minutes.
And you were supposed
to be out here at 6:00.
Well, gee, Dad.
We would've been here,
but the guys didn't wanna
come all the way out
unless they knew you were here.
You know, sometimes we miss
a lot of good stuff
just hangin' around waitin' for ya.
Well, that's too bad.
Well, come on. Come on.
Go on in there and get the guys
out here now in a hurry, you hear?
Sure, Dad.
HI; Dad.
Oh, hi, Beave.
— Well, where are the other boys?
—I don't know.
I come out to get a chocolate bar,
and I thunk I'd see if you was here.
— I just sent Wally in to look for you.
Didn't you see him?
— He must've gone down the other aisle.
[Sighs]
All right. Now, you stay right here.
I gotta go get my jacket.
All right. All right.
Get your jacket. But find Wally
and tell him to get on out here in a hurry.
Well, hello, Ward.
Hello, Fred.
What you doin',
holding up the building?
[Forced Chuckle]
No, I'm just picking up the boys.
Yeah, I came to pick up
my big fella Clarence.
— Oh, uh, how is Lumpy?
—“Lumpy"?
Oh, Clarence is just fine.
Weighs 198 pounds now,
all of it solid muscle.
Hi, Daddy.
Well, Clarence,
say hello to Mr. Cleaver.
Hello, Mr. Cleaver.
Hello, Clarence.
Gee, Daddy, you said
you'd be here at 6:00.
I came out three times looking for you,
and you weren't here.
Mom said you would be.
— Gosh, I missed a lot of the cartoon.
— Well, now, Clarence, don't upset yourself.
Daddy'll buy you a soda
on the way home.
So long, Ward.
See you around the salt mines.
Now, tell me about the cartoon.
[Chattering]
Really a good movie.
HI, Mr. Cleaver.
Oh, hi. Hi.
Hello, Mr. Cleaver.
Sorry to hold you up,
but we had to wait
while a kid was hitting Tooey.
That's all right.
He wasn't hittin' me, Mr. Cleaver.
He was just shovin' me around.
Well— Well, anyway, come on.
Let's get going, boys. I got—
Wait a minute.
Where's the Beaver?
The Beaver?
Yeah, the Beaver!
I just sent him in to look for you.
Didn't you see him?
Yeah, we saw him.
Well, didn't he say anything?
Uh—uh. He just sat down
and started watching the cartoon again.
I'd go back in and get him, Mr. Cleaver,
but that kid would start hittin' me again.
Oh—Oh, no, no.
I think I'd better get him.
Now, don't you fellas go away.
— I'll see that they don't, Mr. Cleaver.
— Thank you, Eddie.
You fellas behave yourselves.
Why don't you pull it all the way down?
It helps your looks.
Oh!
Cut it out, will you?
I already got hit there!
All right, Eddie.
I can do it by myself.
Hi, guys.
Oh, hi, Beave.
Where's Dad?
He went in the theater
lookin' for you.
Cartoon was over, so I come out.
My mother's gonna be awfully sore
if I get home late.
Well, gee.
We can't go without my dad.
— What are we gonna do?
— Let's go back in and look for him.
When we get inside,
let's spread out.
We're just gonna go in.
We've been in here before.
Well, where you been?
Supper's almost ready.
We had trouble finding Dad
at the movies.
Well, uh,
I'll get supper on the table.
You know, you wouldn't have had
any trouble finding me
If you'd been where you were supposed to be.
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
This is the last Saturday
we go through this movie routine.
Well, gee, Dad. What's wrong
with goin' to the movies?
Wally, do you realize you kids
went in that theater today at noon?
It's now 20 minutes after 6:00.
You spent over six hours today
sitting in that stuffy movie theater.
Yeah, they sure give you a lot
For your 35 cents, don't they?
That's not the point I'm making, Beaver.
Look, I should think you boys
would wanna be outside today,
out in the— in the fresh air
where you can breathe.
Gee, Dad.
We can breathe all week.
We only get to go
to the movies on Saturday.
Look, uh, Wally.
You don't have to go to the movies
every Saturday, do you?
Now, take today, for instance.
Why couldn't you kids have gone over
to the athletic field and played baseball?
Gee, Dad, they put up a fence.
They got a guy that chases kids away.
Come now, Beaver
Why would they ha i/e a man at
the athletic field to chase kids away?
Well, he hadn't explain it.
He just tells us to get out of there.
You— Well, all right, then.
All right.
You could've gone over to the park
and, uh, played mumblety—peg.
Gee, Dad. They arrest you
If they catch you with a knife.
All right. Uh—
All right.
You boys better go on upstairs
and get washed up for supper.
Wally, why was that kid
hittin' Tooey in the movies?
I don't know.
I guess he thought he knew him.
What's up now?
June, can you tell me why
they'd have a man at the athletic field
to chase kids away?
Didn't you read about that?
They want the grass to look nice
for the dog show next month.
Oh!
Ward, don't be upset
about the movies.
I'll pick the boys up next week.
They're not going to the movies next week.
Next week, Wally and the Beaver...
are going to enjoy
a well—planned weekend out of doors,
where they can get some fresh air.
They won't get on the athletic field
unless we enter them in the dog show.
June, I'm serious about this.
They need to get out of doors.
They oughta be doing the kind of things
I used to do when I was a kid.
You know what I'm gonna do?
Next weekend,
I'm gonna take 'em up to Friend's Lake
for an overnight camping and fishing trip.
Oh, Ward, that's wonderful.
Yeah.
You haven't had time to do that
in a long time.
No, I haven't.
They're upstairs washing up.
I'm gonna go up and tell 'em right now.
Don't be too long.
Supper's ready.
Say, dear, uh, you're not gonna mind
being alone next weekend, are you?
Of course not, dear.
While you're in the great outdoors,
I'll go to a movie or something.
Yeah. Yeah, Eddie.
This Saturday,
our dad's gonna take us
up to Friend's Lake.
Wally, tell him we're gonna make fire
by knocking two stones together.
Cut it out, will you, Beave?
What's that, Eddie?
Sure, he promised.
[Scoffs]
My pop's the same way.
He promises you somethin'
to keep you quiet.
Saturday comes along,
you remind him of it,
he acts like you got
rocks in your head.
Well, our dad's not like that.
When he promises you something,
he means it.
I'll be seeing you next week...
at the movies.
Like fun you will, Eddie.
Eddie?
Wally, Dad's really gonna
take us campin', isn't he?
Sure he is, Beave.
You know how Eddie is.
Whenever you tell him somethin' good,
he's gotta tell you somethin' bad
to spoil it for you.
I thought we'd get
an early start in the morning.
I, uh, wanna get up to the lake
by 9:00 at the latest.
It was no problem
persuading the boys
to go to bed early tonight.
Beaver was cute.
He didn't wanna get undressed.
He said he wanted to practice
sleeping with his clothes on.
Hey, June, why don't you
come along with us?
Well, I knew you'd ask me
when it was too late for me to accept,
but I didn't think
it would be this too late.
Well, June, you know
you're perfectly welcome.
Well, Thank you, dear,
but I'm too contented here.
I don't think I could bring myself
to leave my garbage disposal
for that long.
[Doorbell Rings]
Oh, uh— Here.
Oh, hello, Fred.
Won't you come in?
No, no. Can't stay a minute.
Well, what's up?
Well, I hung around the sweatshop
today after you left.
Wire from New York.
Thought you'd like to know the scoop.
Well, yeah, I'd be delighted.
What is the scoop?
Well, it seems the big boys
want the Farmington report
we've been working on...
on their desk
first thing Monday morning.
Monday? Well, that means
we'd have to work over the weekend. I—
I was gonna take the boys
up to Friend's Lake.
Of course, Ward,
you can afford to buck the big brass.
I'm just a little frog.
Tell you what I'll do, Ward.
I'll work on the report myself tomorrow.
I'll even sign your name if you want me to.
Thank you very much, Fred,
but I think I'd better meet you down
at the office first thing in the morning.
just have to take the boys
another time.
Well, too bad, Ward.
But, as Sir Walter Scott says,
“The best—laid plans of mice and men
aft gang agley."
That was Robert Burns.
Oh. Well.
see you in the morning.
Yeah.
Are you sure
that wasn't Sir Walter Scott?
Robert Burns.
Oh. Well, if you're sure.
I'll have to ask Geraldine
about that when I get home.
Oh. Well, I guess you heard.
Yes. Oh, Ward, those boys
are gonna be so disappointed.
Well, they've told all of their friends
all week about this camping trip.
I know, dear.
Well, I'd better go up and tell 'em.
Well, they're asleep now.
Well, I'll be up
long before they are in the morning.
I'll tell 'em then.
Ward, do you really have
to work tomorrow?
Oh, no, no.
I could just let it go,
give up my job, sell the house
and we could all live in a tent.
At least that way,
the boys would get to go camping.
That was a very sweet thing to say.
Gee, I'm sorry, fellas.
I-I hope you understand.
I just can't help it.
Your father'll take you camping
next week.
Well, that's okay, Dad.
We understand.
Sure, we do.
Well, uh, have a good day, fellas,
and I'll see you later.
You know, boys, your father
wanted to go on this camping trip
just as much as you do.
But, well, when you're grown up,
You just can't always do
everything you wanna do.
Well, gee, Mom.
That's the only reason I wanna grow up—
so I can do everything I want to.
I don't think anyone
ever grows up that much.
Now, look, fellas, you get dressed
and come on down for breakfast, all right?
Okay, Mom.
Hey, Wally?
Yeah, Beave.?
I don't really understand.
Well, that's because you're just a kid.
Yeah, I guess so.
Wally, those worms we caught,
think they'll last till next week?
I don't think so.
We'd better turn 'em loose
and then catch 'em again if we need 'em.
Yeah. I guess worms should have
as much chance to have fun as anybody.
— Yeah.
— After the morning,
you wanna go to the movies?
Gee, Beaver, we told Eddie
and all the guys we were goin' campin'.
What would we say if they caught us there
watching Vampires of the Amazon?
If we can't go to the movies,
what are we gonna do?
I guess we'll just have to do nothin'.
I'd rather do nothin'
when you have to go to school.
Hey, I'm home!
Hi!
I've been keeping your supper hot.
It's a quarter of7:00.
I thought you'd be home by 5:00.
Dear, Fred was helping me.
Oh.
Where are the boys?
The boys have gone camping.
Camping? Where?
Well, they wanted to go
up in the sand hills,
but they are now roughing it
in the wilds of our backyard.
No fooling?
Uh—huh. They pitched the tent
out in back of the garage.
They took out their sleeping bags,
and they're gonna spend the night.
Well, how are they doing?
Well, they came in
and got some hamburger meat
so they could cook their own supper.
But they asked me if I'd mind
not coming out.
Oh?
Wally said it wouldn't seem like
they were out in the wild...
if their mother stuck her head in
every few minutes.
Well, I think before I eat my supper,
I'll just kind of wander out
and see how they're getting along.
Better wear your red hunting hat.
I think the Beaver has a water pistol.
Oh, well, I'll risk it.
[Deep Voice]
Nobody here but us bears.
Oh, hi, Dad.
Hi.
Hi, Dad. We thunk it was Eddie
or some of the kids messing around.
I almost let you have it.
Oh.
Well, you, uh—you fellows did
a pretty good job of getting this up.
Well, it fell down a couple of times,
but then Beaver
stood in here and held it up
while I drove in the stakes.
- Oh.
— I'm just about the same size
as the tent poles.
Well, you know, fellas,
I'm still sorry about that camping trip.
But we're gonna make it
for sure next weekend.
That's okay, Dad.
We're having a lot of fun out here.
Well, that’d swell. Fellas, I think
I’d button up this tent flap though.
It's beginning to blow up
a little bit outside.
[Wally] Okay, Dad
If you smell anything burnin' in the morning,
that's just us cookin' our breakfast.
All right, Beaver.
Well, good night, fellas.
And if you need anything,
just yell.
[Wally] Gee, Dad
We can take care of ourselves.
We're just about grown up.
[Beaver]
Sure, Dad
We learned how to do things
for ourselves just like you said.
Oh,yeah.
Yeah, I-I guess you have, Beaver.
Good night, fellas.
Good night.
Hey, Beave, where'd you put the eggs?
They're in my knapsack.
Oh, good.
In the morning,
let's pretend these are eagles' eggs,
and we had to climb
to the top of a mountain
to get 'em out of the eagle's nest.
What would you wanna do that for?
I got a scratch on my arm.
We can pretend
that's where the eagle clawed me.
You can pretend what you want to,
but I'm just gonna eat 'em.
And, anyway, who ever heard of an eagle
laying a hard—boiled egg?
It's a little dried out, but it's hot.
You know, the boys
are doing great out there.
Paper said it may rain.
Think they'll be all right out there?
Ah, they'll be perfectly all right.
The thing for us to do is to leave 'em alone
and not spoil their fun.
I suppose so.
Hmm! You know, you talk about
Wally and the Beaver.
When I was a kid,
Chuck Tollifson and I slept in a tree.
You had a tree house?
No.
We just slept in a tree one night.
Well, what'd you do that for?
We wanted to tell the kids at school
that we slept in a tree.
We were quite the celebrities
Of the fourth grade.
Two days later,
Lindbergh flew the Atlantic,
took the play away from us.
You're making that up.
Oh, no. He really flew the Atlantic.
It was in all the papers.
Can you pour me some coffee?
[Thunderclap]
Sure sounds neat when it rains
on a tent, doesn't it, Wally?
Yeah.
You know, Eddie Haskell says
if you touch the inside of a tent
while it's rainin', it'll start a leak.
Ah, that Eddie.
He thinks he knows everything.
Will it really start a leak
If you just touch it?
I don't know.
That's what Eddie says.
[Dripping]
Eddie was right.
There must've been a hole there
or somethin'.
It couldn't start a leak
just by touchin' a tent like this.
Boy, that Eddie sure is a wise guy.
Wally, look over there!
So what? We're campin' out.
A little water's not gonna hurt us.
Sure, it's not gonna hurt us.
We'd better get to sleep.
It's a lot better with the light out.
We can't see the rain comin' in.
Look at the way
it's coming down.
Ward, I think you oughta go out
and tell those boys to come in.
June, I disappointed them
about the camping trip.
I can't go out there now
and spoil what little fun they are having.
Anyway, there's nothing more exciting
to a boy than lying in a tent
listening to the rain.
But the wind!
What if the tent blows over?
They'd just be lying there in the rain.
Dear, they're right
in their own backyard.
I suppose so.
I have to admit, I, uh,
kind of wish they'd come in myself.
But we couldn't make them.
Ah, they'll be all right.
I'm gonna get a glass of hot milk
and go up to bed.
[Thunder Rumbling]
You asleep, Wally?
No, I'm not asleep.
I thought you were asleep.
No.
I'm not asleep either.
You okay?
Oh, sure.
But it kind of feels like
the water's comin' in
the sleepin' bag with me.
I'd better turn up the lantern
and see how we're doin'.
I'm glad we stopped those leaks.
Boy, this is somethin'!
Yeah.
I bet we got the only tent
with runnin' water.
— Somethin' bothering you, Wally?
— Heck no.
You wouldn't be thinking
about goin' in the house
or anything like that, would you?
No, of course not.
We're campin' out.
And, anyway, even if we were thinkin'
Of goin' in, we couldn't go in.
Well, sure.
Why couldn't we?
Because we told Mom and Dad
we could take care of ourselves.
If they ever saw us comin' in
on account of a little bit of rain,
they'd think we were a couple of sissies.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I think we'd better do somethin'
about this water.
Whatever we do,
we'd better do it real quick.
[Door Opens]
Oh, hi.
Good morning, dear.
How are the boys doing this morning?
They're fixing
their breakfast out there.
Glad they're all right.
That was an awful rain we had last night.
We must have a leak.
There are wet spots
all over the carpet on the stairs.
Are there?
Mm—hmm.
I'm gonna have to call Dunlap,
have him check our roof.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, dear.
I think the boys made those spots
on the carpet last night when
they carried their sleeping bags upstairs.
When did all this happen?
Well, I must've looked out of that window
two or three times last night...
to see if that tent had blown over.
It was about midnight.
You were sound asleep.
How'd they get in?
Well, I, uh, may have accidentally
left the kitchen door unlocked.
Accidentally?
They went back out when
the rain stopped this morning.
It was around 5:00.
Ward, how were you so sure
those boys would come in?
Well, I wasn't.
But I wanted the back door unlocked
in case they did.
Sounds like
you've been through this before.
Yeah.
The time Chuck Tollifson and I
slept in that tree,
after a couple of hours,
his father came out
and made us come down.
We'd have given anything if
he'd just left the back door unlocked.
Will you hold still, Beave?
We'll be late for Sunday school.
You mean you guys
took the sleeping bags
and slept out in a tent last night?
Yeah, we slept out there
most of the night.
It was real neat.
Boy, my pop wouldn't let me
sleep out in the rain.
He'd have come out and dragged me into
the house and make me take a— a hot bath.
— Didn't your pop make you come in at all?
— Heck no!
Boy, I wish I had a father
who never cared what I did.
Come on.
We'll be late for Sunday school.
Wally, Dad does care what we do,
doesn't he?
Sure he does, Beave.
Who do you think
left the door unlocked last night?
