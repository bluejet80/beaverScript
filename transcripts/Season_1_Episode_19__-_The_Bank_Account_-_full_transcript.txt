Title: Leave It to Beaver (1957–1963): Season 1, Episode 19  - The Bank Account - full transcript

Wally, why do you have to leave school
at lunchtime to get Dad the jacket?
Well, this way, we can buy the jacket
and still get back in time to put the rest
of the money in the bank account.
I sure hope Assistant Principal Mr.
Bloomgarten doesn't catch us sneaking out.
Well, we'll go out the girls' entrance.
He never watches that door.
Wally, why doesn't he ever
watch the girls' entrance?
Well, 'cause girls
never do anything bad.
[Announcer]
Leave It To Beaver.
Starring Barbara Billingsley,
Hugh Beaumont, Tony Dow...
and Jerry Mathers as the Beaver.
[Door0pen5]
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.








[Both]
Hi.
You got home early today, didn't you?
Yeah, things were a little slow,
so I took a powder.
Well, that means
he ducked out, Beave.
What's in the package?
Your father picked that up
For you on the way home.
Oh, boy. I'll bet it's the extra track
for my electric train.
— What is it?
— Well, boys, it's a piggy bank.
Yeah, I guess that's
what it is, all right.
Your father thought you could start
saving your dimes and quarters in it.
I thought it was about time
you started learning about thrift.
Now, you feed this pig every day,
and you'll be surprised how fat he grows.
Look, I have a quarter.
Now, I'll start you off.
Now, here's half a dollar.
Well, what about you boys?
Well, I guess I got
a couple of dimes here.








Well, I guess I got five cents.
But I was gonna give it
to Larry Mondello for a horse tooth.
He "founded" it in the street.
Well, come on, Beave,
everybody else put something in.
Now, you see?
You've got a dollar in there already.
Sure, you keep that up,
and before you know it,
you'll have a small fortune.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Dad.
Sure.
Supper will be ready
in a little while, boys.
Wally, I got a great idea.
What’s that?
Let's break the pig open
and spend the dollar.
Oh, no, Beave.
Let's keep putting money in
for a couple of months,
and then we'll break it open.
Okay. I can hardly wait
till it's a couple months from now.
We must have a couple
of pounds of money here.
Yeah, well, we're gonna need a lot.
That catcher's mitt I'm getting
costs eight bucks,
and the fielder's mitt
you're getting costs $5.98.
Honestly, these socks.
I don't know how Wally and
the Beaver wear them out so fast.
Well, that's no problem for a boy.
Boys have lots of systems
for wearing out socks.
Carrying marbles in them, or playing
basketball without their shoes on.
[Chuckles]
I used to strain gas for my
outboard motor through mine.
Oh, there's no problem wearing out socks
if you really put your mind to it.
Well, I'm afraid that one's too far gone.
Well, there's one I can fix.
You know, you're quite
the little mother.
Well, there were two practical things
I learned in boarding school.
One was how to mend socks,
and the other was how to make a court bow
in case I married a foreign diplomat.
So far, I've only had a chance
to mend socks.
That's tough luck.
But that's the way the ball bounces.
Must be reassuring, though,
to know that if the queen ever
does drop in, you'll be ready.
Yes.
Have you noticed how quiet
Wally and the Beaver are tonight?
Yeah, I have.
I think I'll, uh, see what's up.
Well, I'd think
you'd be glad they're quiet.
Oh, no. I remember the things
my brother and I used to do
when we were quiet.
I don't want them planning
to do things like that.
Well, if the silence bothers you,
go on up and put a stop to it.
I think I will.
It sure is a swell fielder's glove.
In the ad it says it's the kind
Babe Ruth used to use.
Yeah, I know.
[Piggy Bank Rattling]
Wally.
What?
Who's Babe Ruth?
Well, he was before your time.
[Rattles]
I think he was a little
before my time too.
— Hi, fellas.
- Oh, hi, Dad.
Hi, Dad.
What you doing?
Nothing.
Oh, I see.
Well, you're pretty
busy at it, aren't you?
We're just getting some
money out of our bank.
Yeah, Dad. I'm gonna buy
an eight—dollar baseball glove.
And Beaver's gonna buy a $5.98 one.
Well, gee, fellas.
I thought you both had baseball mitts.
Yeah, but Wally doesn't
wanna play first base anymore.
And the stuffing's
coming out of mine.
Well, that's just a little rip.
That could be sewed.
Probably another of the useful arts
your mother picked up at boarding school.
Gee, Dad. I feel kind of silly
behind home plate with
a first baseman's glove.
Well, now, look, boys...
uh, it's your money.
[Chuckles]
You saved it, and I'm not gonna try and
tell you what you oughta do with it.
— You spend it any way you want.
— Gee, thanks, Dad.
Wait a minute, Beave.
I don't think Dad thinks we ought to
buy the glove, do you, Dad?
Well, now, if you asked my advice, uh—
Well, uh, take me, for instance.
I'm going hunting this next
Saturday with Mr. Dennison.
And I'd like to have a new hunting jacket.
My old one's six or seven years old.
But I'm not gonna go out and buy a new one.
But if we oughtn't to buy the gloves,
what do you think we oughta do
with the money?
Well, uh, tomorrow
is bank day at school.
If I were you, I'd take this over
and put it in my bank account.
You're gonna be going
to college one of these days.
And you'll find that money
will come in mighty handy then.
Of course, uh, of course
I want you to think it over
and make up your own minds.
I won't interfere.
I’m gonna have to start
getting up earlier.
You say that every morning.
Yeah. Well, one of these mornings,
I'm gonna do it too.
Where are the boys?
They're up getting their books.
They've already had breakfast.
I hope they take my advice
about putting that money in the bank.
Now, Ward, you told them
they could do whatever they wanted to
with their money. Now let them.
Oh, I intend to.
It's gonna be very interesting...
to see whether they're up to
handling their own money yet.
[Footsteps Approaching]
Bye, Mom.
Bye, Mom.
So long, Dad.
Hey, fellas.
What's in the paper sack?
Looks kind of heavy.
Well, we got our money
in there, Dad.
Yeah, today's bank day.
We're gonna take it down
and put it in our school bank account.
— Gee, Dad we almost got $32 in there.
— Yeah, we counted it twice.
Well, I think that's fine, boys.
Better wear your jackets today.
Okay, Mom.
Bye, Mom. And I'll go easy
on my socks today.
Oh, don't look so smug.
Oh, don't you think you might have
let them buy the baseball gloves?
But, June, I didn't tell them
they had to put that money
in the bank.
It was entirely their own idea.
They'll thank me for it someday.
Wally, get my jacket for me, will ya?
Hey, what's this?
I don't know.
Maybe it’s something
Mom was gonna give away
Hey, I know what this is.
This is Dad's old hunting jacket.
Sure doesn't take very good care
Of his stuff, does he?
Well, he said he'd had it for eight years.
He's done a lot of hunting in this jacket.
[Sniffs]
I think he's done some fishin' in it too.
You'd think he'd buy a new one.
Well, he can't, Beave. When you're
an older person, you can't throw away
your money on things like this.
You gotta throw it away on food
and furniture and junk like that.
What do you think?
Well, Dad's always buying us stuff.
Maybe we could use
a little of the money
and buy him a new hunting jacket.
There'll still be plenty
left over for the bank.
Sure. A jacket like this
couldn't cost more than
a good catcher's mitt.
[Bell Dings]
Wally, why do you have to leave school
at lunchtime to get Dad the jacket?
Well, this way, we can buy the jacket
and still get back in time to put the rest
of the money in the bank account.
I sure hope Assistant Principal Mr.
Bloomgarten doesn't catch us sneaking out.
Well, we'll go out the girls' entrance.
He never watches that door.
Wally, why doesn't he ever
watch the girls' entrance?
Well, 'cause girls
never do anything bad.
Oh, Ward.
I didn't expect you home for lunch.
No? Who did you expect?
Shouldn't that be,
"Whom did you expect"?
Well, "who" or "whom,"
you're stuck with me.
I was in the neighborhood looking
at some property for the office.
Can I fix you some lunch?
No, don't bother.
Oh, on second thought,
If there's any of that roast beef left,
you might warm up a couple slices of that.
You'll like it
much better cold, dear.
I’m sure I will.
[Rings]
Hello?
Oh, Mrs. Rayburn.
I'm calling about Wally and Theodore.
I understand they left the school grounds
at lunchtime without permission.
They told their teachers
they were going shopping.
Shopping?
Oh, incidentally, Mrs. Rayburn.
Did the boys make a deposit
in their school account this morning?
Well, I'd appreciate it
if you would check.
No. No, neither of the boys
made a deposit.
Were they supposed to?
Oh, no, no. Not exactly, no.
Well, I'll certainly speak to them when
they get home tonight about leaving
the school grounds without permission.
And thank you very much
for calling. Bye.
It will be a few minutes, dear.
I'm heating your roast beef.
That was Mrs. Rayburn,
the school principal.
The boys didn't deposit that money
in their bank account.
Well, that's funny.
They said they would.
Well, it's obvious
they didn't take my advice.
Not only that,
they left the school grounds
without permission.
Undoubtedly went off
to buy those baseball gloves.
Well, Ward,
it is their own money.
June, that's not the point.
I-I don't know when I've been
more disappointed in those two.
Oh, now, Ward.
That's the trouble with kids.
Just when you think you've built up
a real understanding with them,
a real man—to—man relationship,
they turn right around
and start acting like children.
Well, you know what I mean.
We don't have too much time, Beave.
We gotta get back to school
before they find out we've gone.
Yeah, after we buy the jacket,
we'll put the rest in the bank.
Hey, Wally.
look at the funny—looking ducks.
Those aren't ducks.
They're decoys.
They sure look like ducks.
What are they for?
Well, when you're hunting ducks,
you put these out in the water,
and then the real ducks come down
and you shoot 'em.
But why do they come down?
These are only made of wood.
Yeah, but they don't know that
until they get there.
Then it's too late.
It must be tough being a duck.
Uh, may I help you lads?
Yeah, we'd like to get
a hunting jacket.
This way, please.
You sure got a lot of guns.
You got any B.B. guns, mister?
I'm sorry. Abernathy Potts
doesn't carry air weapons.
Now, what kind of hunting jacket
did you lads want?
Uh, bush jacket, safari—type,
or rugged, Scotch hunter's coat?
— Huh?
— I'll show you what we have.
It don't matter too much.
It's for our father.
Yeah, but we wanna get
a good one though.
Of course. What type of hunting
does your father do?
Well, mostly,
he likes to hunt ducks.
They're birds.
Quite.
What size does your father wear?
Well, he's kind of, uh—
— Well, he's bigger than you think he is.
— Especially when he's mad.
Uh, suppose we try the medium size.
Here's a very popular coat.
Fine English needlework.
And good Scotch ruggedness.
Wally, you try it on.
I fit's enough too big for you,
it oughta be just right for Dad.
Uh, would you hold our money, mister?
Why, of course.
What do you think, Beave?
It'll probably look better on Dad.
I think so too.
We'll take it, mister.
Fine, will this be a charge?
No, we got our money
right here in the bag.
We got $31.60.
Yeah,just take out how much
it costs and give us back the rest.
Oh, I'm sorry,
but that won't be enough.
this jacket is $45.12,
tax included.
$45?
We thunk it'd be around six dollars.
Boys, this jacket
will last your father a lifetime.
I'm sorry, mister. We gotta put
some of this money in the bank.
Sure wish we could
buy it for our father.
I understand, boys.
I was fond of my father too.
Well, thanks a lot.
Sure was a nice—looking jacket,
wasn't it, Beave?
Sure was.
You know, I think we oughta
get Dad that jacket.
But where will we get
the extra money?
I just thought of where we can get it.
Come on, Beave. Let's go.
Hi, dear.
Oh, hi.
Where— Are the boys home yet?
Well, I don't know.
I just got home myself.
I had to go to a meeting.
What's for supper?
Cold roast beef.
Well, that figures.
[Phone Ringing]
I'll get it.
[Continues Ringing]
Hello. Oh, Mrs. Rayburn.
I'm sorry to bother you in the evening.
I phoned earlier,
but there was no answer.
Oh, well, Mrs. Cleaver
was away at a meeting—
Oh, the boys did get
by the office after school?
Well, they made the deposit then, huh?
— Oh—Oh, they didn't?
— They not only didn't make the deposit.
They withdrew $1 0 apiece
from their account.
I was reluctant to give it to them,
but after all, it is their account.
Oh, yes.
Yes, that's perfectly all right.
Well, thank you, Mrs. Rayburn.
31,32,33—
What an extraordinary—looking coin.
Well, that's a quarter, mister.
I put it on the railroad tracks.
I thought I could make
a half—dollar out of it.
But it didn't work.
[Chuckles]
Well, I suppose we could
stretch a point and accept it.
Hey, could we take it now?
We wanna hang it in the closet
to surprise Dad.
I thought it would be rather nice
if we put his monogram on it,
on the inside, naturally.
We'll send it over by special
messenger tonight. What say?
That would be fine.
Thanks, mister.
Now, remember, Beave.
Don't say anything tonight
and give it away.
Who, me?
Well, uh,you boys
are very quiet tonight.
Yes, sir.
Something on your mind?
Oh, there's nothing on my mind.
Nothing on your mind either,
is there, Beaver?
No, sir.
I mean, no, Wally.
You boys have a hard day
at school today?
Gee, Mom.
Every day is hard at school.
The hardest part is waiting for 3:00.
Boys, today was bank day
at school, wasn't it?
Yeah, I guess it was.
Pass the cookies, please.
Pass the cookies, please.
Uh—
[Chuckles]
Uh, boys, uh, didn't you tell
your mother and me this morning...
that you were going to
deposit that $30 you'd saved
in your school savings account?
Uh,yeah, we did.
Well, did you or didn't you?
Yes, we told you, all right.
Boys, your father wonders
if you put the money in the bank or not.
Uh, no, sir. We didn't.
Oh.
Well, uh, would one of you care
to tell us what you did do
with the money?
No, I wouldn't.
Gee, Dad
You said it was our money
Well, I know that, Wally.
But after all, you boys left the school
grounds today without permission...
and you spent quite a lot of money.
Now, don't you think you really
owe us an explanation?
Well, gee, we'd like to,
Dad, but, well, we can't.
Oh. You can't, huh?
Can I be excused?
I've got a lot of homework.
I suppose.
They gave me homework too.
Now, Ward don't lose your temper
I'm not going to lose my temper.
But I'm not going to wait
much longer for them to tell me
what they did with that money either.
I don't care if I did tell them
they could do anything
they wanted to with it.
Well, thank you very much.
What's that?
"Wallace and Theodore Cleaver."
It's from Abernathy Potts.
Don't they sell sporting goods?
They sell the most expensive
sporting goods in town.
Well, they usually go to
Haney's Hardware Store.
Why would they go to Abernathy Potts
and spend that kind of money
on baseball equipment?
Because they have absolutely
no understanding or appreciation
of the value of$50.
Will you call them
down here please, dear?
Boys, will you come
down here a minute?
Now, Ward,
don't get excited about this.
I'm not gonna get excited.
But if they're going to spend money,June,
they've got to learn to spend money properly.
[Door0pens]
But they're young.
They'll learn.
[Footsteps Approaching]
You wanted to see us, Dad?
Yes, boys, I did.
This box just came.
Now we're all going
to sit down and open it.
But, Dad—
Sit down, sit down.
And we're going to decide as a family
whether or not you boys have spent
your money for something worthwhile.
Gee, you gonna open it, Dad?
Yes, I am.
And if we feel, as a family,
that you boys have made a mistake,
then we're going to return this
to the store, and we're going
to get your money back.
You—
— Ward, it's a hunting jacket.
— Yeah.
Me?
Well— Well, boys,
I—I just don't know what to say.
Let me help you, dear.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Must we gotta take it back
tonight, Dad?
Well, Beaver,
I wouldn't take this jacket back
for anything in the world.
Gee, Dad, we would have told you
how we spent the money,
but we wanted to surprise you.
Your father understands.
Yeah, I understand.
I, uh— I just hope you boys
understand me. I—
We—Well, you see,
I got sort of upset...
when I thought you were just
squandering your money on
baseball equipment for yourselves.
Yeah, Dad. We didn't squander the money
on ourselves. We squandered it on you.
— Yeah.
— Yeah.
So I guess I kind of jumped
to conclusions, didn't I? I'm sorry.
That's okay, Dad. We still love you,
'cause you're our father.
— Thanks, Beaver.
— Well, we better go upstairs
and take our baths.
We'll come up and say good night
To you in a few minutes.
Ward, it's kind of warm
in here tonight.
Aren't you gonna
take your jacket off?
Oh, no. No, I'm not
uncomfortable in the least.
Not in the least.
Wally, Dad really liked
the hunting jacket, didn't he?
Yeah, he sure did.
But he was pretty mad
at us at suppertime.
I thought we were really gonna get it.
I know. Me too.
You know, Wally,
next time we surprise Dad,
maybe we oughta play it safe
and let him know
a little bit ahead of time.
Yeah.
I guess I could stuff
the stuffing back in this glove.
Sure. And I guess I won't look
too silly playing catcher
with a first baseman's glove.
Good night, Wally.
Good night, Beave.
