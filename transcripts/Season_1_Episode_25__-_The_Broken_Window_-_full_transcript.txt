Title: Leave It to Beaver (1957–1963): Season 1, Episode 25  - The Broken Window - full transcript

Oh?
Oh. Well.
thanks a lot, mister.
Somethin' wrong, Wally?
I'll say there is.
It costs almost $16
to get the window fixed.
And all we've got is $6.35.
Yeah. And Mom and Dad
will be home pretty soon too.
[Announcer]
Leave It To Beaver.
Starring Barbara Billingsley,
Hugh Beaumont, Tony Dow...
and Jerry Mathers as the Beaver.
U h-huh.
[Children Playing]
No, Fred, I'm sorry.
Ward isn't home yet.








Can I have him call you back?
[Children Shouting]
Fred, I can't quite hear you.
The boys are playing ball outside.
Oh, you'll call him back.
This is the night of your Spanish lesson.
Oh, well, fine.
What?
Oh, well, uh, buenas noches
to you too, Fred.
Bye.
[Children Continue Playing]
— Eddie, are you ever gonna take a cut at it?
— Put it right over here.
Just once when I play ball
with these big guys,
I'd like to get up to bat.
— Me too.
— Come on, Wally.
Put it right over here.
Right here. Come on.








[Boy]
Eddie, are you ever
gonna take a cut at it?
Come on, Wally.
Come on, Eddie, will ya?
Put it right over here.
Right over here, Wally.
[Boy]
Hurry up. Come on.
Come on, Eddie.
Cut out the grandstandin'
and hit it.
Yeah, we've been playin'
for over an hour
and you haven't hit one yet.
Aw, leave me alone.
I'm not gonna pull any muscles.
Huh. What muscles?
Who do you think you are,
Ted Williams?
Go ahead and hit it.
My leg's goin' to sleep.
[Boys laughing, Chattering]
You warmed up so much,
you went stale.
Aw, pipe down. Come on, Wally.
Try to put one over, will ya?
I got it! I got it!
Hey, let's get outta here!
Wally, shouldn't we run too?
We can't. It's our house.
I don't mind too much
gettin' it for ourselves,
but I sure hate gettin' it for Eddie.
[Clears Throat]
Hi, Dad.
Hello, fellas.
Those other guys sure took off
in a hurry, didn't they?
— They sure did.
—Something wrong, boys?
Uh, well, we just
broke a window, Dad.
You broke the window, Wally?
I was pitchin', and Eddie hit it.
I don't know if it was on account
of the way I threw it or on account
of the way he hit it.
— Anyway, the window's busted.
— Yeah, it certainly is.
Now, look, boys,
common sense should tell you...
that playing ball this close to the house,
you're bound to break a window.
[Door Opens]
Ward, Fred Rutherford's
on the phone.
Tell him I'll call him back.
He can't wait.
He has to take
his Spanish lesson.
All right.
I'll see you boys later.
So this is the crash I heard.
This is it.
What did your father say?
He didn't get a chance to say it yet.
Well, don't worry about it.
Dinner'll be ready in a minute.
Maybe my lamb chops will help.
You know, Mom,
when we're in a mess,
you kind of make things
seem not so messy.
Well, isn't that sort of
what mothers are for?
All right, boys.
The window's broken,
and it's simple enough
to have it repaired.
But I just want
one thing understood.
From now on,
there'll be no ball playing
close to the house, right?
— Right, Dad. We promise.
— Yeah, we promise.
Because if there is any more
ball playing near the house,
I'm going to be
very, uh, disappointed.
— You mean you won't like us
anymore, Dad?
— Well, let's just say that...
it wouldn't make me very happy
to feel that you'd broken your word.
Now, that's that.
We'll hear no more about the subject.
Wally, pass the bread, please.
Thank you.
[Chuckles]
Of course, uh,
when I was a boy,
If I'd broken a window,
I'd have had to pay for it.
— Gee, with your own money?
— You bet with my own money.
Not only that, but I'd have gotten
a pretty good taste of the strap too.
Gee, Dad, you must've had
a real mean father.
I wouldn't call him mean exactly,
but he certainly had a fine sense of values.
Dear, why don't you tell the boys
how you had to sell matches in the snow
on Christmas Eve?
Gee, Dad, can I
do that sometime?
Uh, never mind, Beaver.
— I thought we'd agreed
to drop the subject.
- So did I.
— Weren't you a little late tonight, dear?
— Yes, I was, dear.
— I, uh, had to stop by Mac's Garage
to pick up the car.
— Oh.
I had to leave it there this morning
to have the brakes checked.
I thought Mac checked the brakes
just six months ago.
Oh, yes. Yes, he did
But it seems that someone
had been driving the ear...
for quite a few miles
with the emergency brake on.
— Not very good for them, you know.
— So I've heard.
Ward, you wouldn't be implying
that I drove the car with the brakes on,
would you?
Why, dear, I said no such thing.
Just to put your mind at ease,
no matter how many times I drive that car,
I'll never use the brakes again.
Now, June, you—
Um—
I think we'd better
drop this subject too.
Gee, do we have to, Dad?
It was just gettin' good.
— Wally, you're not eating your lamb chops.
— Yeah.
It's fun gettin'
our own breakfast, Wally.
Yeah.
You know, Mr. Cornelius
took Mom and Dad out
to look at lots in his car.
Are Mom and Dad
gonna buy a lot?
No. Lookin' at lots is just one of
those things grown people do.
Now, Ward, this piece
of property that I'm
going to show you and Mrs. C.,
it's what I call
"a friendly piece of property."
What I mean is,
it practically reaches out
and shakes hands with ya.
Well, it's been some time since I
shook hands with a vacant lot.
Huh?
Very good, Ward.
Very good.
But, Corny, this seems like
very expensive property, you know.
There's no sense in our looking
at something we can't afford.
Well, I always say, "A person
never knows what he can afford
until he goes into debt."
That's the way to find out
your financial capacity.
Now, look, Corny,
when I need financial—
Never mind, dear.
You're probably right.
It's a great neighborhood for children.
They're even talking about
putting sidewalks in.
Why didn't you bring
the offsprings along, huh?
— They were going off to play ball.
— You left them by themselves, huh?
Huh. I'll never forget the time the missus
and I left little Jimmie John alone.
He was eight or nine at the time.
We had one of those little doors
cut in the kitchen door,
you know,
for the cat to come in and out.
Sure enough, when we got back,
there was little Jimmie John
with his head caught in it.
— Was he hurt?
— No,just a little frightened. That's all.
The cat was very upset. Yeah,
you should've brought the boys along.
Well, I'm quite sure
they're all right.
We don't have a cat.
Hey, Wally, let's do that again
and pretend the house is on fire.
Yeah, that'd be neat,
but we gotta go play baseball.
Oh, yeah.
The guys are waiting
over at Metzger's Field.
Hey, Wally, I thought we was
gonna have fried egg sandwiches.
We were, but the yolks broke,
So I scrambled 'em.
Yeah, it's funny how
eggs can get away from ya.
We can mess around a little while
till Eddie gets here.
— Throw me one, Wally.
— You know we're not supposed
to play ball near the house.
Just throw me one.
I never hit it anyway.
Okay, I'll throw it easy.
[Glass Shatters]
— Beaver, somethin' broke in there.
— Let's go play ball.
We better look
in the garage first.
I sure hope
it's not what I think it is.
S—So do I.
Uh—oh, Wally. This is the second
window we've busted in two days.
Yeah. And we promised Dad
we wouldn't play ball
around here anymore.
What" we do?
We're in real big trouble.
I don't know.
After what Dad said last night,
there's no tellin' what he'll do.
Hey, Wally, isn't Eddie Haskell comin' over
to walk us over to Metzger's Field?
— We could ask him what to do.
— Hey, that's a good idea, Beaver.
Eddie's been in just about
every kind of trouble a guy could get in.
[Phone Ringing]
Uh—oh. I wonder
who that could be.
I don't know,
but we'd better answer it.
Yeah. At least we can't get
into trouble doing that.
[Ringing Continues]
That's funny.
They don't answer.
They've probably already gone over
to play ball.
Oh. Oh, hello, Wally!
Is everything all right?
Oh, sure, Mom.
Oh, us?
We're not doing anything.
—just messin' around.
— Did you have a good breakfast?
I see. Uh—huh.
Ice cream and doughnuts?
No, they started out to have fried eggs,
but they ended up with scrambled.
— Oh, that figures.
— Uh, Mom, what time
are you gonna come home?
Well, we thought we'd stay out
and have lunch with Mr. Cornelius.
— You and Beaver'll be all right, won't you?
— Oh, sure, Mom.
I think everything" be all right
by the time you get home. Bye.
Good—bye, Wally.
Take good care of Beaver.
By the way he talked,
they don't care if we ever come home.
Well, you know how kids are.
I guess I used to be
the same way.
But you had a real mean father.
After lunch,
I wanna show you good people
the Willoughby property.
That other place
was much too expensive.
But we've got a great break
on the Willoughby deal.
You see, there's been a divorce,
and I think we can just step in
and take advantage of it.
What do you think
we should do, Eddie?
Well, that depends.
Your father's out, huh?
Yeah.
Him and Mom went
to look at building lots.
Then what are you worried about?
You just roll it down
and don't say nothin'.
That looks pretty good, Eddie.
Yeah, but, Eddie, but sooner or later,
they're gonna roll up the window.
What do we do then?
You just look surprised and say,
"Gee, Dad, I wonder
how that could've happened."
No, Eddie, we can't do that.
Okay, if you don't know
good advice when you hear it.
You comin' over to play ball?
Yeah, we might be over later.
Okay.
Wally, maybe we should have told Mom
on the phone about the busted window.
Yeah.
What do we do now?
I guess we just have to get a hold
of some money someway...
and get it fixed
before they get back.
You know, Beaver, I never knew
you could hit a ball that hard.
[Wally]
Here comes another nickel.
Well, I guess that's all.
How much we got, Wally?
We got $1.85.
You know, Wally,
Dad checks the piggy every night
to see how we're doin'.
He's gonna know it's empty.
No, he won't.
We'll put washers in it.
Then when he shakes it,
it'll sound like we got money.
You know, Wally, you're gettin' more
like Eddie Haskell all the time.
You cut that out, Beaver.
And this is mine.
This ain't mine.
This is mine.
This is mine.
This ain't mine.
This ain't mine.
This is mine.
This ain't mine.
[Cash Register Clanging]
Here you go.
Wally, which do we have more of,
"is mines" or "ain't mines"?
I don't know.
All we've got is 65 cents.
Well, boys, I can let you have
$1.] 8 for all this stuff,
provided, Of course,
you throw in the wagon.
What do you think, Wally?
Well, it's not too much,
but we're too tired
to haul this junk all the way back home.
All right, Fats.
Yeah, mister.
It's last year's model.
Oh?
Oh.
Well, thanks a lot, mister.
Somethin' wrong, Wally?
I'll say there is.
It costs almost $1 6
to get the window fixed.
And all we've got
is $6.35.
Yeah. And Mom and Dad
will be home pretty soon too.
[Horn Honks]
You know, Wally,
maybe something good
might happen before they do.
Beaver, what could happen?
I don't know.
I just hope somethin' does.
You know, I wouldn't mind so much
if Dad would yell at us...
and even hit us, but I sure hate
the way he's gonna look at us.
Yeah.
Wally, let's run away.
Run away?
Where would we go?
I don't know.
We could call up the bus company...
and ask'em how far
you could go on $6.35.
That's a goofy way to run away.
If you're gonna run away,
you should at least know where you're goin'.
Yeah. I guess we're just gonna have to
stay here and let Dad look at us.
Where ya goin', Wally?
I'm gonna go outside
and roll down the car window.
It might at least
get us through supper.
Well, you boys
are very quiet tonight.
No, we're not, Dad.
we just ain't sayin' nothin'.
Uh, I, uh, guess you guys
are kind of tired from lookin'
at lots all day.
I guess we are.
Then I guess you won't be
going anyplace in the car...
or anything like that.
No, as a matter of fact,
we thought we'd all
go to bed early tonight.
In fact, we thought we'd
go to bed very early...
so we'll be all ready
for our drive tomorrow.
— We goin' somewhere?
— We sure are.
You guys have been after me
for two weeks to take you
up to Crystal Falls.
Okay. Tomorrow we're gonna
drive up there for a picnic.
— In the car?
— Of course in the car, Wally.
— What's gotten into you this evening?
— Nothing.
Gee, Dad, do we have to
go on a picnic?
Now,just a minute, fellas!
You've been after me for two weeks
to take you to Crystal Falls. All right?
Your mother’s packed a lunch.
I’ve canceled a golf date.
We're going on a picnic tomorrow
and have a wonderful day,
and don't you sit there
and tell me we're not.
— Yes, Dad.
— Yes, Dad.
Well, if you boys aren't
gonna finish your dessert,
you may be excused.
Thanks, Mom.
Dad,
if you wanna shake our piggy bank,
we left it in the kitchen.
Thank you, Beaver.
June, those two are up to something
If they don't wanna go on a picnic.
Oh, I don't think so.
They've probably eaten
a lot of junk today...
and their little stomachs
just aren't up to it.
But if you feel that way,
why don't you talk to them?
Yeah, I think I—
No, I don't think so.
After looking at vacant lots all day,
whatever they're up to, I'm not up to.
Well, Beave, Dad's sure to see
the car window tomorrow.
I still think we ought to
pack our stuff and run away.
No, we can't do that now.
It's almost our bedtime.
Well, gang,we've got
a great day fora picnic, huh?
Aren't we all glad we came?
I am.
What about you boys?
I guess I am.
Oh, I guess I am too.
Oh, uh, Beaver, roll up
that window, will you, please?
What'd you say, Dad?
I said, "Roll up the window."
The winds blowing
on Wally and your mother.
It's not blowing on you,
is it, Wally?
No. I didn't even know
it was open.
[Chuckles]
It's not blowing on you,
either, is it, Mom?
— As a matter of fact, it is.
— Beaver, will you please roll up that window?
—I can't, Dad.
— Well, why in the world can't you?
'Cause we broke the window, Dad.
Oh. You broke the window, huh?
Yes, Dad. Yesterday, when you and Mom
was out lookin' at lots,
me and Wally were going over
to Metzger's Field to play baseball,
and I asked him to throw me one.
I don't usually hit 'em,
but this time I hit
and it "broken" the window.
We was gonna run away,
but we only had $6.35, sir.
Yeah, Dad. We were gonna try
to get it fixed before you got back.
I'm sorry we broke our promise
about playing ball near the house.
But just the same, Beaver,
do what your father asked—
roll up the window.
Gee, whiz!
The window's not busted anymore.
— Then somethin' good really did happen.
— Well, I'll tell you what happened, boys.
Last night, I went out
to put something in the car,
and I slammed the car door.
I heard glass breaking.
I thought I'd done it.
Yes, and your father knew
we were gonna use the car today,
so he took it down this morning,
and Mac fixed the window.
Uh—oh.
Well, it's all out
in the open now.
— You sorry you told me?
— Sorry?
Yeah. If you hadn't told me,
I'd never have known about it.
Boys, with your father thinking
that he broke the window,
would you ever have told him?
—I guess we would, after a while.
— Uh, when "after a while"?
Someday, when we'd done somethin'
real good... and you was real happy about it.
Come here, you little rascal
The guys are gonna meet us
Over at Metzger’s Field?
That’s what they said.
Bye, Dad. We're going
over to Metzger's Field.
Have a good ball game,
and don't stay too late.
I'll remind them when it's time
to come home, Mr. Cleaver.
I have a watch.
Thank you, Eddie.
Here, boys.
Here are your sandwiches.
Thanks, Mom.
Thank you, Mrs. Cleaver.
Good—bye, Mom.
Beaver, don't let the ball hit you.
Oh, no, Mom.
[Door Slams]
Hey, you never told me.
What happened about
that busted car window?
Did you get away with it?
No, our father found out.
But I told you what to do.
How come he found out?
He found out because we told him.
—You told him?
—Yeah, we told him.
What'd he do,
let you have it across the puss, huh?
No, he didn't hit us.
He's just gonna take the money
out of our allowance.
Is that all? My old man would've let me
have it right across the puss.
You know somethin'?
You guys have got
a real goofy father.
You cut that out, Eddie,
or you really will be gettin' it
across the puss.
And it won't be
from your father either.
All right, all right. Let's go.
Don't make a big thing out of it.
