What do you think you're doing?
I'm painting the trash cans.
What for?
For 50 cents apiece.
That was supposed to be my job.
I made a deal with Dad.
I made another deal with Dad.
You little sneak.
You went behind my back
and took the job away.
You said you didn't want it.
At least you coulda told me
you were gonna do 'em.
Then I coulda done 'em first.
That's your tough luck.
All right. You'd better
quit that painting,
or I'm liable to sock ya.
You come near me,
I'll let you have it with the paintbrush!








[Announcer]
Leave It To Beaver.
Starring Barbara Billingsley,
Hugh Beaumont, Tony Dow...
and Jerry Mathers as the Beaver.
Well, so long, Mom.
So long, Mom.
Well, aren't you boys
a little early this morning?
Well, we washed our faces,
we combed our hair,
we brushed our teeth
and had our breakfast.
There wasn't anything else to do,
so we thought we might as well go to school.
Yeah, we can kill some time
at the playground.
Where's Dad?
Well, your father's outside
picking up the trash the trashman left.
Oh. Oh, can I have
20 cents, Mom?
Oh, can I have
20 cents too, Mom?
Twenty cents?
What's it for?
— They're having a drive at school.
— Well, that's fine. What's it for?








I don't know.
They just said bring 20 cents.
Why don't you
ask your father for it?
Okay, Mom. Good—bye.
Bye.
Bye, Mom.
Have a good day.
Where?
At school!
Oh.
Oh, hi, Dad.
Hi.
How you doin'?
Oh, not bad.
I think we're gaining
a little on the city.
They took a little more trash
than they left this morning.
Yeah, I guess they did.
Hey, you know, these cans
are getting kind of rusty.
Gonna have to paint 'em this weekend.
Paint 'em?
— Gee, Dad, I like to paint. Could I do 'em?
— Well, that's nice of you to offer, Wally.
Tell you what though.
I think this is a little
above and beyond the call of duty.
—I don't think you should do it for nothing.
—I don't think so either. Ha!
[Chuckles]
Well, what do you think it's worth?
Well, there are
two big cans there.
How about 50 cents apiece?
Okay. It's a deal.
I'll get the paint today.
You can do 'em after school.
Okay, Dad.
Come on, Beave.
Dad? Could we each
have 20 cents?
Yeah.
You won't forget the paint,
will ya, Dad?
No, of course not.
Hi, dear.
Hi.
Oh, boy, what a day.
Everything happened.
Everything that could,
and a few things that couldn't.
That's too bad.
Did you bring it?
Bring what?
Bring what?
The paint
for the trash cans.
Oh, honey,
I had a terrible day!
I didn't have time
to think about trash cans.
Well, Wally came right home from school,
put on his old clothes, and he's been
waiting for you for an hour and a half.
Well, I'm sorry—
Hi, Dad!
What color did you get?
I'm all set
to paint the cans.
I'm all set to watch him.
Oh, um,yeah, uh—
Well, gosh, fellas,
I've been so busy today, I—
Well, I’m afraid I just forgot
Oh.
Oh, well, that's okay, Dad.
We can jump in the car
and go down and get the paint now.
Well, yes, uh, we could.
But, uh— No, I'm afraid
by the time we got down there
the stores'd all be closed.
Wally, your father
won't forget again.
And anyway, you can paint 'em
just as well tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Hi, dear.
Hi.
Oh, I thought,
with all your housework,
you didn't have time to read anymore.
— I'm reading a cookbook.
— Good idea.
Thought we'd have
a chocolate mousse for supper.
It's the wrong time of year.
Moose are out of season.
[Both Laughing]
What put you
in such a happy mood?
Oh, not a thing.
I just thought I'd come home
and, for once, not complain about
the hard day I'd had,
sympathize with
any and all of your
domestic problems, and, uh,
bring home the paint
for Wally to paint
the trash cans.
Well, that's very nice,
but I don't have any domestic problems,
and Wally's out playing baseball.
He's playing baseball?
Well, he said he'd be here.
I think he was counting on you
forgetting the paint again.
Look, June, I forgot the paint once—
Dear, maybe you could go out
and paint the cans.
Well, I, uh—I made
a deal with Wally,June.
I couldn't let him down.
Oh, of course you couldn't.
Now,June, I'm merely
trying to teach the boy...
a sense of responsibility.
From a sitting position?
Yes, more or less.
Have a hard day?
Boy.
You know, Wally, if the sun
hadn't been in my eyes,
I'd have got a couple hits today.
Yeah, sure, Eddie.
It was just bum luck
you struck out six times.
Ehh!
Gonna play tomorrow,
Wally?
I can't, Eddie.
My dad's bringing home some paint.
I'm gonna paint those trash cans.
These big things here?
Yeah. I'm gettin'
50 cents apiece for 'em.
Fifty cents apiece?
When my old man had his painted,
the guy charged him three dollars.
Well, yeah, but he was probably
a real painter and did a good job.
How can you do a bad job sloppin' paint
on a couple of old trash cans?
You're gettin' gypped, kid.
I think Dad
giving me a dollar is okay.
What do you mean?
He'd have to pay a stranger three dollars.
Why should he take advantage of you
just because you're unlucky enough
to be a member of the family?
Oh.
Oh, Wally, your father
brought the paint home tonight.
Uh, paint?
Well, yeah, for the trash cans.
I thought you could paint 'em
tomorrow afternoon, after school.
Oh.
Well, uh, you—
you don't seem very enthusiastic.
I thought you wanted the job.
So did I. You were going to get
A whole dollar.
Well, gee, I don't know
if I'm gonna have time.
Wally, what is this?
Yesterday you were all upset
because I forgot to bring the paint home.
You sure were, Wally.
Well, we're playing baseball.
And anyway,
Eddie's father paid a guy three dollars
to have his cans painted.
[Gasps]
Wally, you're not asking your father
to pay you three dollars, are you?
Oh, no. No.
I just said that's
what Eddie's father paid a guy.
Well, I assure you I have no intention
of paying that kind of money
for painting trash cans.
As far as I'm concerned,
we made a deal for 50 cents apiece,
and that's the deal.
Yeah. Well, I guess I can
get around to 'em one of these days.
One of these days?
Can I be excused, Mom?
I got a lot of homework.
I suppose so.
Y—
Uh, thanks for
the nice supper, Mom.
Thank you
Pass the cream, dear.
It’s right there
in front of you, dear.
Oh. Thanks.
Dad?
Yeah?
What is it, Beaver?
I'll do 'em for nothin'.
Well, now, that's
a very generous offer, Beaver.
-But/—
— Beaver, we should wait
until Wally makes up his mind.
I'll do a real good job.
We'll have the prettiest trash cans
on the whole block.
Well, I'll say this, Beaver.
I think if you did do the job, you should get
the same money Wally was going to get.
I guess I could take money,
If you wanted me to.
All right, I'll tell you what.
Since Wally doesn't seem
interested in the job ,
I think you could have a try at it.
— Gee, thanks, Dad.
Can I be excused?
— Sure. Run along.
Ward.
Yeah?
I hope you haven't
started something here.
Started something?
I'm just trying to get
the trash cans painted.
Well, first you promised
the job to Wally, and now
you've given it to the Beaver.
Wally doesn't want the job .
Wally said he didn't want the job ,
but I don't think he meant it.
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
it sounded a lot more like he didn't want it
than it sounded like he did want it.
But, Ward, look—
Honey, instead of arguing,
why don't we just relax...
and appreciate the fact
that we're going to have
the prettiest trash cans on the block.
What you doin', Wally?
I'm squeezin' a tennis ball.
That's a funny kind
of homework.
I'm doing it so I can get
a good grip on the baseball.
Don't be such a little wise guy.
Hey, Beave, what happened
after I left the table?
— Mmm, nothing.
— Didn't Dad say anything?
I guess so.
Well, what'd he say?
Mmm, he said, um,
pass the cream.
Hey, Beave, you think I oughta
paint those trash cans
for 50 cents apiece?
Uh, I don't know.
I never painted any trash cans.
Wally, are you gonna be
playing baseball tomorrow?
Yeah, I guess so. Why?
Wanna come along and watch?
Watch what?
Watch me play baseball.
No.
Well, then, why’d you ask?
So I'd know if you're
gonna play baseball or not.
Hi, dear!
Hi.
You're home early!
Yeah.
I have to go over to Chandler's
and get him to sign some papers.
Where are the boys?
Well, Wally's off playing baseball
and the Beaver's out in the garage
painting the trash cans.
He has half the rags
and the newspapers
in the house out there.
Well, he's not like his brother, is he?
He got right on the job .
Before I go to Chandler's,
I think I'll just run out
and see how he's getting on.
You know, he's got quite a sense
of responsibility, hasn't he?
Uh-huh.
[Chuckles]
I wonder who he takes after.
Hi, Beave.
Hi, Dad.
I'm paintin' the cans.
Well, that's fine, Beaver.
But, you know,
you really shouldn't
paint over the rust.
The rust is there.
I gotta paint over it.
Let me show you
What I mean.
Let's see.
Where's that steel wool?
Now—
[Grunts]
There. You see?
Now, you wipe that off, and you got
a nice, clean surface to paint.
What makes rust, Dad?
Well, oxidation.
It eats into the metal.
Why don't they make cans
out of wood?
Wood rots.
Gee, there's something wrong
with just about everything, isn't there, Dad?
Well,just about, I guess,
Beave.
Look, you clean the rust off,
and then paint. Huh?
Okay, Dad.
All right.
I'm going over
to Chandler's now, honey.
All right.
How's he doing out there?
Oh, he's painting everything in sight,
including the rust.
Maybe we should have waited
for Wally to do them.
If we waited for Wally,
we would have wound up
putting our trash out in paper bags.
I won't be long.
Uh,jet plane, mister.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm painting the trash cans.
What for?
For 50 cents apiece.
That was supposed to be my job.
I made a deal with Dad.
I made another deal with Dad.
You little sneak.
You went behind my back
and took the job away.
You said you didn't want it.
At least you coulda told me
you were gonna do 'em.
Then I coulda done 'em first.
That's your tough luck.
All right. You'd better
quit that painting,
or I'm liable to sock ya.
You come near me,
I'll let you have it with the paintbrush!
— You wouldn't do that!
— Oh, no? I'm littler than you are.
I gotta use anything I can!
Okay.
But I'm just tellin' you somethin'.
You'd better quit that paintin',
or you're gonna be sorry.
One and three quarter cups of milk.
One cup of sugar, salt—
Hi,Wally.
How was the ball game?
All right, I guess.
Don't eat anything.
Supper will be ready soon.
I don't want any supper.
Wally.
what's the matter?
Why wouldn't you
want any supper?
Because you and dad and everybody
are against me, that's why.
But, Wally—
[Door Slams]
Hi, dear.
How's the happy household?
Far from happy.
Wally just went upstairs
and slammed his door.
It seems that you and I
and the whole world's against him.
Must have seen Beaver
painting those trash cans.
I told you he was
counting on doing them.
I know you did.
Well, actually,
it's too much for Beaver.
I don't think we'll have
any trouble talking him into
letting Wally take over.
Oh, Beaver!
Look at you!
Honey, you go on upstairs
and see if you can
get yourself cleaned up.
Say, Beave?
About those trash cans—
If you let that big ape Wally do 'em,
I'll never speak to you again as long as I live.
Well?
Now what happens?
Well, I guess at supper tonight
the Great White Father
assumes the role of peacemaker.
— Dad?
— Yes? What is it, Beaver?
Wally's got his elbows on the table.
Yes. Um, Wally?
Well, um, this is
a delicious roast, dear.
Well, thank you, dear.
Dad, Beaver's chewing
with his mouth open.
Boys, couldn't we have
some pleasant faces at the supper table?
— Yes, Mom.
— Yes, Mom.
Uh—
[Clears Throat]
You know, I heard something
pretty funny down at the office today.
[Laughs]
Uh, do any of you know what is purple,
has four eyes and eats people?
[Ward Continues Laughing]
I don't.
[Chuckles]
A four—eyed, purple people eater!
[Laughing]
— Pass the bread, please.
— [June Laughs]
I, uh—I thought
that was funny.
Didn't you, Wally?
Yeah, I guess so.
I think I heard it before.
Yeah, he thinks
he knows everything.
— Listen, you—
— All right, boys, I've had enough of this.
Now, there's no reason for you
to act this way just because
there was a mix—up about the painting.
But, gee, Dad first you promise me,
and then you gave the job to him.
When a promiser makes a promise,
he should keep it.
Now, look, boys,
I'm sure your father has a solution
to this whole thing.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
Now, there are two trash cans.
Each of you will paint one.
And each of you
will receive 50 cents.
I'm not gonna paint
with that big ape around.
You don't have to work together.
Each of you is responsible for his own job.
Now do we understand each other?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
[Laughing]
[Chuckling]
What?
What is it, Beaver?
A flying purple people eater.
That's pretty funny!
[All Laughing]
Wally.
Yeah?
I'm not mad at you.
Are you mad at me?
No, I guess
I'm not mad at ya.
Are you supposed to
paint the insides?
I don't know.
Leanin' over to paint the inside
Would just mess up the outside.
Yeah, I guess it would.
After I get finished with mine,
I'll help you with yours.
Thanks, Wally.
Wally!
Hey, you guys!
Hey. What's up?
There's a fire down
at the lumberyard.
No foolin'?
Yeah, the whole place
is goin' up in flames.
Come on.
Let's get over there
before they put it out.
Where are you going?
There's a fire
over at the lumberyard.
We wanna get there
while it's still burnin'!
I was the first one that heard about it,
Mrs. Cleaver. I saw it while
I was taking my music lessons.
[Beaver]
I sure hope Gus makes this fire
with Old Number 7!
But, boys—
Oh, dear!
You're home early.
Well, it's a good thing I am.
I just looked in the garage.
I'm gonna change my clothes
and finish painting
those trash cans myself.
The boys
ran out on the job .
Dear, you can't blame them too much.
They went over to see
the big fire at the lumberyard.
Fire?
Yes.
They couldn't resist it.
And after all,
they are just boys.
Tom Courtney's lumberyard?
Yes.
It's been on the radio.
Why, they've called
fire companies out
from all over.
Must be quite a fire.
Yes, it must be.
Dear, I wonder if you'd go out
to the garage and put those brushes
in some turpentine. I won't be too long.
[Door Opens, Slams]
Once a boy, always a boy.
Boy, I never saw so many
fire engines in my whole life.
Have you, Dad?
Not since the dance pavilion
burned down years ago.
Everybody was there
but Gus and Old Number 7.
Hey, look, Dad.
The cans are painted.
Did you finish 'em
for us?
Uh, no, boys.
I didn't.
Then—
Oh.
Well! You three kids
have fun at the fire?
Yeah!
Oh, uh, by the way, dear,
I wanna thank you
for painting those trash cans.
Yeah, give her
a dollar, Dad.
[Ward Chuck/es]
Oh, I wouldn't think of it.
And anyway,
my reward is on its way.
That, uh, new hat
you told me not to buy
until after the first of the month?
Well, I'll be.
You'll be what?
I don't know. A four—eyed,
purple people eater, I guess.
[All Laughing]
Wally, how much you think
Mom's new hat cost?
I don't know.
You know how women's stuff is.
Maybe 10, 15 dollars.
That's a lot to pay for somethin'
that can't even keep your head warm.
Yeah. I guess us running out on Dad
cost him a lot more than a dollar.
Well, he ran out on his job too
when he heard about the fire.
Yeah. I guess he's a lot like us.
But why would a grown—up like him
wanna go to a fire?
I don't know. I guess maybe
he wanted to see if fires
have changed any since he was a kid.
