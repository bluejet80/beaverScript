Title: Leave It to Beaver (1957–1963): Season 1, Episode 32  - Beaver's Old Friend - full transcript

Mom, when were the trash men here?
Oh, just about 10 minutes ago.
Did they turn the corner?
I guess so.
Beaver, don't you want your sandwich?
I'll be right back, Mom.
I gotta catch the trash truck.
But, Beaver—
Where's he going?
He has to catch the trash truck.
Well, that figures.
[Announcer]
Leave It To Beaver.
Starring Barbara Billingsley,
Hugh Beaumont, Tony Dow...
and Jerry Mathers as the Beaver.
Uh—huh. Yes.








Well— Now, let me
get this straight, Fred.
You say that if we buy a water softener,
then the company gives you
$25 off of the one you bought?
What's that, Fred?
Oh, and if you get five people to buy them,
then yours won't cost you anything.
Well— Fred, I'd better
talk this over with Ward.
He's out cleaning the garage now,
and that's something
I wouldn't want to interrupt.
No, Fred, I haven't anything
against soft water.
It's just that I'd like
to talk it over with Ward.
Oh, here, Wally.
You can get rid of this.
Gee. What is it, Dad?
Looks like a life preserver
with the cork out of it.
It's a tire cover
from an old roadster I had.
Wally, what's a roadster?








Well, I think it's somethin'
people used to ride around in...
in the olden days.
Yeah, that's, uh— that's right.
It replaced the covered wagon.
Go on. Get rid of it.
Here, Beave.
Hey, guys. Look.
Look at this.
[Chuckles]
Gee, an old cannonball.
No, Beaver.
That's a shot put.
I came awful close to setting
the school record with this once.
What do you do with it?
Well, the object is to toss it
as far as you can, Beave.
Here.
I think I'll stick to throwin' rocks.
Okay. Here.
Uh— Hey, Dad,
you gonna put it in the trash?
Oh, uh—Well, um—
Remember, Dad?
You said we were gonna throw away
everything we couldn't use anymore.
Yeah, um—
Say, Wally, I don't suppose you—
Gee, thanks, Dad, but—
Well, I might wreck my pitchin' arm.
Yeah.
Well, farewell to the days of our youth.
Hey, Dad.
Hmm?
What's this awful smell?
It's turpentine.
What's this messy—looking thing?
Hey, that's Billy!
Well, whoever he is,
he's had quite a turpentine bath.
Hey, guys, we gotta cut out this stallin'
and get the job finished.
Aunt Martha gave Billy to me
when I was sick in bed with the measles.
Here you go, Beave.
Me and Billy used to sleep together
when we lived in the other house.
Hey, should I throw this out, Dad?
No, we'd better hang on to that.
We can get a new handle for it.
He used to keep me warm,
and I used to keep him warm.
What about this, Dad?
Toss it out.
Billy used to make a sound
when you "squoze" his stomach.
What'd you say, Beave?
He went—
[Growling]
Oh.
Well, come on, guys.
We'd better get this stuff out
and into the trash barrels, huh?
Beave, you bring that one.
Hey, Dad, sure you don't wanna
save this thing?
Nah, we gotta
stick by our rules, Wally.
[Billy Growls]
Billy!
What's the idea, Wally?
You did it right on his stomach.
So what? He can't feel it.
Hey, Dad, can I go over to Eddie's now?
Sure, go ahead. I can finish up.
Thanks a lot for the help, fellas.
Maybe if I put him out in the sun,
the smell would go away.
Hey, Beaver, don ’t hold that old thing
up against your clothes.
It’ll get all over ‘em.
Yeah, Beaver.
Why don't you throw it in the barrel?
That’s kids ’5tufif
[Ward]
Yeah. Anyway, Beave,
you’re too big to play with doll; now.
Sure. Of course I is.
Hey, Beaver, you gonna come over
and watch us play ball?
No, Wally, I'm tired
Of watching you guys do stuff,
and then not gettin' to do it.
— What are you gonna do?
— I don't know.
The guys are comin' over later.
I think I'll play with them.
Okay, well, I'll be seeing you, Beaver.
So long.
So long, Wally.
[Whistling]
[Whistling]
Hey, I thought you were
goin' with Wally.
Uh—uh.
Something you want?
No, I don't want anything—
anything at all.
You finish the garage?
Yeah, all finished.
You know, I can't figure it out.
We threw away everything that was worthless,
and the garage
is still half full of junk.
Well, don't worry about it, dear.
One day we'll move
and leave it all behind us.
Oh, Fred Rutherford called.
What'd he want?
He says if we and four other people
buy water softeners,
then he and Geraldine
get theirs free.
Well. And if five other people
send us $200,000 apiece,
we'd be millionaires.
You know, that's a much better deal.
Hi.
Hi, Dad.
Are you all finished with the garage?
Yeah, all finished.
Hey, Beave, where you goin’?
Chuck and the other guys
are comin' over later.
I thunk I'd mess around outside
until they came.
Well, uh,
what do you and the guys have planned?
Gee, Dad, it's no fun to plan stuff.
They're just comin' over.
Oh, no, you don't.
You'll spoil your lunch.
This?
The, um, cellar stairs?
The cellar stairs.
Hey, Beaver!
Hi, Beaver.
Hi.
What you doin'?
Nothin'.
What are you guys doin'?
We're lookin' for pop bottles.
This is the day
people put their trash out.
Maybe there's some in the garage.
Why don't you go look?
What you got there?
— Where?
— Behind your back.
Yeah!
What do you got there?
Cut it out, Chucky.
Hey, look, fellas.
Beaver's playin' with dolls.
I am not.
I just found it in the trash.
Then what are you doin' with this?
It sure is a smelly old thing,
all right.
It's funny—lookin' too.
It's just an old piece of junk.
I'd better throw it back in the trash.
Wait a minute.
— We can have fun with this old thing.
— Doin' what, Chucky?
You know that big dog
in Mr. Parker's yard?
You know what he does when
you throw somethin' over the fence.
Yeah, he'll rip it to pieces.
— Yeah!
— Let's go!
Wait!
Wait? What for?
I don't think the dog is home today.
Forget the doll.
We came out to look for bottles.
Yeah. Everybody's got their trash out.
I bet there's a lot down the street.
You comin' with us, Beaver,
or are you gonna stay there
and play with your teddy bear?
I'll come with you guys.
You comin’, Beaver?
The boys gonna be home
for lunch?
Beaver is.
Wally's eating with Eddie.
Who was that on the phone before?
That was Fred Rutherford.
He wants to know if we're gonna go
for his deal on the water softener.
Didn't you tell him no?
Well, dear,
you don't tell Fred no.
I, uh, told him I'd think about it.
We'll just keep telling him that
until he gets his own paid for.
Oh. I'll get you some more.
[flattering]
Trash men.
Billy!
[June]
Beaver?
I have a sandwich for you.
What are you doing?
Just neatin' up the barrels.
Mom, when were the trash men here?
Oh,just about 10 minutes ago.
Did they turn the corner?
I guess so.
Beaver, don't you want your sandwich?
I'll be right back, Mom.
I gotta catch the trash truck.
But, Beaver—
Well, where's he going?
He has to catch the trash truck.
Well, that figures.
I used to chase the ice wagon
and eat ice off the back.
Ward, he's not going to eat trash.
Well, of course not.
You've got a sandwich for him.
Oh!
Hi, mister.
Hi, sonny.
If you're looking for pop bottles,
we're just fresh out.
No, mister.
I wasn't lookin' for pop bottles.
I live on Mapleton Drive.
I "losted" somethin',
and I think it's in your truck.
Oh? And you want me
to empty the truck...
and spread everything out here
on the street so you can find it, huh?
No, mister.
Just let me get up there and dig around.
I'll find what I want.
Well, I'm afraid
I couldn't let you do that.
[Horn Honking]
Just a minute, Charlie.
Well, now, son, whatever it is you lost,
sounds to me like it's pretty important to you.
What was it?
Billy.
- Billy?
— He's a bear.
— He's "stuffted."
— Oh!
I really gotta find him, mister.
Okay. I'll get up there
and look for him.
Thanks, mister.
Mister?
Yeah?
Just walk around up there.
If you step on his stomach, he'll growl.
Well, thank you.
He hasn't had his lunch yet, and I was
getting a little bit worried about him.
Good—bye.
Fred Rutherford again?
No, I've been calling around
about the Beaver.
He's been gone for almost an hour.
He probably got tired chasing
the trash truck and found something
more interesting to chase.
Like what?
Oh, I don't know.
I used to chase girls.
I suppose he's a little young for that.
Mrs. Mondello said he ran by her house
about a half an hour ago.
Where do you suppose
he could've been going?
June, when you're eight years old
and you're running, you don't have
to have anyplace to run to.
You just run for the sake of running.
I suppose so.
Hi, Mom, Dad. I'm home.
Hi. Did you have
a nice lunch at Eddie's?
Well, Eddie's mother gave us
a bunch of little, tiny pink sandwiches.
I think she had 'em left over from
a club meeting a couple days ago.
Is that all you had?
Well, they're not bad eating
if you jam a bunch of 'em together.
I suppose not.
Wally, have you seen the Beaver?
Not since this morning, Mom.
After I put my glove away,
I'll go look for him.
Now, why do you suppose Mrs. Haskell
would serve tea sandwiches
to two big, growing boys?
Well, you know Agnes.
I suppose she didn't wanna
throw them away.
Boy, Billy.
you smell worse than ever now.
You're not good—lookin',
but you're the only bear I ever had.
Hey, Beaver.
What are you doin',
talkin' to that thing?
Well, I, uh—
Boy, Mom's been lookin'
all over for you.
Oh, I know.
I had to chase the trash truck
for almost eight blocks.
Boy, Beaver, you must
really like that old thing.
I guess I do.
But why? It's just an old,
beat—up hunk of junk.
Well, you promise you won't laugh
If I tell ya?
Uh—uh. I was a kid
like you once myself.
Well, you remember
at the other house...
when I had the measles,
and they wouldn't let you
or any of the other guys in...
'cause they might get 'em?
Yeah.
Well, Mom was kind of busy,
you know, around the house,
and Dad was at work.
Sure. What about it?
Well,
there wasn't any real people around,
So I made—believed Billy
was a real people.
I even made—believed
he had the measles with me.
Gee, Beave, I never knew that.
But that was when
you were just a little kid.
What are you gonna do with him now?
Well,
I figured he did
somethin' nice for me once,
So I should do
somethin' nice for him.
At least gettin' him
out of the junk wagon.
Yeah, but Mom and Dad
aren't gonna let you keep
a smelly thing like that,
even if he did
have the measles with ya.
Wally, I was just thinkin'.
Maybe there's something
we can do to "unsmell" him.
Come on, Beave.
Absolutely nothing in this paper.
You've been reading it
for an hour.
Well, you have to read it
to find out there's nothing in it.
Is that you, Wally?
Uh, yeah, Mom.
I found the Beaver.
We're goin' up to our room.
[Ward]
Uh, Beaver, come here a minute.
What" I do with him, Wally?
Here.
Turn around.
Beaver!
Well, come on over here.
I wanna talk to you.
Yes, sir.
Where have you been all afternoon?
Your mother was very worried about you.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I had a sandwich
for your lunch and everything.
— Where did you go?
— just around.
Now, let's understand
each other, Beaver.
When you leave this house,
I want your mother
to know where you are.
You're not to do this sort of thing again.
Yes, sir.
Can I go now,
or do you wanna yell at me some more?
Beaver, your father's
not yelling at you.
We just want you to know
that we were very worried.
Yes, Mom. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
[June]
Beaver, did you have any lunch?
Sure, Mom.
I ate in the candy shop.
Ward?
Hmm?
When the Beaver was here,
did you notice anything?
You mean that strange smell?
Oh,you did notice it.
What do you suppose it could be?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess when two boys
are out playing all afternoon,
they're entitled to pick up
some interesting odors.
[Sniffing]
Boy, I was sure
they were gonna smell him.
Me too. Have you thunk of any way
to "unsmell" Billy yet?
Well, the only way
to get rid of one smell...
is to find another smell
that drowns it out.
That's not gonna be easy.
You sure the Haskells are gonna bring
the boys home after Sunday school?
Uh-huh.
You know,
I think this is a perfect opportunity
to clean up their room.
That's a great idea.
It's a rule at the zoo, you know.
Always clean the cages
while the lions are out.
I better go take a look
and see how big a job it is
before I get in my workin' clothes.
Well, how do you like this?
It's immaculate.
I don't understand it.
It's not Christmas,
and there are
no birthdays coming up.
What do you suppose happened?
Dear, I hadn't noticed
until we came up here,
but aren't you wearing
a great deal of perfume?
No more than usual.
It does smell
like my perfume, though.
[Sniffing]
Well, don't look at me.
Ward, it's in here.
It's in this room someplace.
You know, it's stronger back here.
Not in here.
I've narrowed it down
to this corner.
Yep. This is it.
Well, it's Beaver's old teddy bear.
Why, I haven't seen him in years.
We found that when we were
cleaning out the garage.
I threw it out in the trash.
It reeked of turpentine then.
Ward, he must've rescued him.
What would he drag out
an old thing like that for?
Don't you remember?
Why, when the Beaver was younger,
this is practically
the first friend he ever had.
He treated Billy like a real person.
Oh, yeah.
Guess I should've paid
a little more attention
down in the garage.
I'm afraid Wally and I
sort of kidded him about
still wanting to play with dolls.
Oh.
I'm gonna take Billy downstairs,
and I'm gonna give him
the best cleaning he's ever had.
You know, Ward, it's funny.
We all like to hang on to something
that reminds us of
some happy occasion of the past.
Yeah.
You know,
I wouldn't tell this to everyone,
but, uh, at the last minute,
I turned chicken and rescued
my old shot put from the trash can.
Well, why don't you go out
in the backyard and practice...
while I take care
of our other juvenile problem?
Don't go too far.
Dinner's almost ready.
Oh, no, Mom.
I'm just goin' across the street.
What do you have there?
Billy.
Billy?
Thanks for dry—cleaning him, Mom.
You're welcome.
I used a button for his eye.
He looks great.
Beaver, you're not gonna take Billy outside
and play with him, are you?
Oh, no, Mom. I'm too big for that.
I'm gonna give him to Benjie.
Little Benjie from across the street?
Yeah. They think
he's got the measles.
And when you got the measles,
Billy's the best friend you can have.
You know, Beaver,
I think that's very nice of you.
And then when Benjie
grows up like I has,
he can give Billy to
some other lucky kid who's sick.
