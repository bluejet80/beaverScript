Leave It To Beaver.
Starring Barbara Billingsley,
Hugh Beaumont, Tony Dow...
and Jerry Mathers as the Beaver.
Say, I got home after you fellows
had gone to bed last night.
Oh, great, Dad.
The coach says right now
I'm practically first—string pitcher.
Well, that's swell, Wally.
Hey, did you hear that, June.7
First—string pitcher.








How about you, Beaver?
Did you go out for the "C" team?
Oh, sure, Dad.
The coach threw each guy two flies.
I caught the first one,
but the second one hit me on the head.
On the head?
I knew something like this
would happen.
It hit me real hard,
But I didn't cry though.
What did the coach say?
He said I wasn't good enough
for the team.
If I had "knowed" that,
I wouldn't have bothered not to cry.
Well, Beaver—
Hey, Dad it’s gonna be real neat.
We get to wear uniforms...
and get to ride on buses
to games and even/thing
[Ward]
Wally, I’m really proud of you
Hey, I tell you what.
After I get home from work tonight,








If you want to, we'll go over
to the vacant lot and play some catch.
— Gee, that'd be great, Dad.
— Me too?
Well, we'll be using a hard ball, Beaver.
I-I expect you'd better just hit the homework.
Oh, Beaver, I wouldn't be upset
about not making the team.
There are lots of other things
you can do at school.
Sure, there are. Anyway, you're gonna
be a ballplayer one of these days.
That's right. And in the meantime,
well, there must be
something else you like to do.
Something that—
Something that especially appeals to you.
Well,
I like to wade in big puddles.
But I don't think
they have a team for that.
Hi!
Have a good day at the office?
Miserable.
That's nice.
Oh, come here.
There's something over here
from the boys' school
on the desk for you to sign.
Well, if it's their report cards,
I'd better wait till I'm in a better humor.
It's permission for the Beaver
to take music lessons.
Music?
Uh-huh.
He's never been interested
in music before.
Well, I guess he was so disappointed
about not making the baseball team,
he wanted to go out for something.
Huh.
At least there's nothing in the band
to hit him on the head.
I wouldn't be too sure of that.
You're really going out
for the band, Beaver?
Yeah. I get to wear a uniform.
And for five dollars, you get free lessons.
Boy, they got all kinds
Of instruments here.
Which one are you gonna play?
I don't know.
It's kind of hard to tell by lookin'
which one is the easiest.
— What's that?
— That's a tuba.
Tuba.
You ’re too small for that, Beaver
And, anyway, Tooey's been playing
the tuba since the fifth grade.
Does he have to polish it all the time?
Nah. He gets his mom to do it for him.
Here's somethin' that looks good.
What's that?
That's a clarinet.
I think I'll go out for that.
It looks easy to carry.
I sure hope it sounds good.
Oh, uh, supper's ready, boys.
You'd better get washed up.
Okay, Dad.
I, uh, understand you're going to take
some music lessons at school, Beaver.
Yeah. I think I'm gonna go out
for the clarinet.
I don't know how it sounds,
but I like the way it looks.
Well, that's fine.
I, uh—I do hope, though,
that it's not gonna turn out like
the ice—skating lessons you had last year.
Remember?
You quit after one week.
Oh, no. I don't think
I'll fall down playing the clarinet.
I don't think so either.
I, uh,just hope you stick with it, that's all.
Oh, sure, Dad.
[Be/l Ringing]
Hey, Beave, how you doin'
with the clarinet?
Great, Wally. They taught us
how to take it apart today.
How you coming
with baseball, Wally?
Well, we didn't have
a regular practice today.
Coach gave us a lecture
on how to lose with a smile.
[Door Closes]
How you doin' with Mr. Willet?
Fine. He taught us
how to spit on the reed today.
Hi!
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mom.
I've been worried about you two.
We ate dinner with the team
on the way home from Bellport.
Good.
I, uh, take it you won.
You bet we did.
The old pro here only allowed 12 runs.
Is that good?
Well, it is when your team's
scoring 1 4.
Hey, where's the Beaver?
I wanna tell him all about the game.
He's been waiting
for you to come home.
This is a big night for him.
He's gonna play something for us.
On the clarinet?
Uh-huh.
Oh, boy. I gotta hear this.
He looks like he's been
doing this all his life.
And after only five lessons.
Six, Mom.
Come on, Beave.
Will you quit showin' off
and play somethin'?
Now, be quiet, Wally.
["America" Out Of Tune]
Well, that was very nice, Beaver.
Wasn't it, Ward?
Oh—Oh, yes.
Yes, it certainly was.
Uh, as a matter of fact,
it, uh, sounded vaguely familiar.
Well, of course it did.
It's "America."
[Humming "America"]
Well, sure!
Of course it was "America."
Hey, Beave, play it again.
Sounds like there's somethin' missin'.
Yep. That's "America," all right.
But, Beave, tell me.
Why do you always stop there?
'Cause that's how far I memorized.
Mr. Willet says as soon
as I learn the last few notes,
I can go on with the other guys.
Oh. Well, that's fine.
You wanna come upstairs
and watch me take it apart?
Well, why don't you fellas
go on up now.
I'll be up a little later.
Okay, Dad.
Wally, you didn't say nothin'.
How'd you like it?
Well, for a guy that just learned how
to spit on the reed a couple days ago,
I thought it was pretty good.
Oh, Ward, wasn't he cute
with that clarinet?
You gotta give him credit.
He certainly thinks he can play it, doesn't he?
I practiced my piece
four hours yesterday,
and my mother says if I don't make it,
she's gonna phone Mr. Willet.
Mr. Willet told me
I got a pretty good chance.
Mr. Willet didn't tell me anything,
but I think I got a pretty good chance too.
You, Beaver? Mr. Willet's
just giving you lessons
because he had an extra clarinet.
You're awful.
Isn't he, Whitey?
He's not really awful.
He just sounds that way
when he plays.
You just wait and see what happens
this afternoon, Beaver.
You just wait and see.
[Piano]
[Stops]
[Resumes]
[Ends]
Yes, I-I think with a little work,
That’ll be fine, Judy.
Thank you, Mr. Willet.
Bye, Mr. Willet.
Bye, Judy.
All right, now, uh, Herbert.
["Mary Had A Little Lamb"]
Excuse me.
Thank you, Thomas.
I don't believe we're quite ready
for the orchestra just yet.
Perhaps with
a little more practice, hmm?
[Playing Scales]
— Well, that's gonna be very—
— Continues]
Oh, that's—that's fine, Whitey.
You're making real progress.
Thank you, Mr. Willet.
I practiced a lot at home,
except when my big brother hits me.
Well, you keep it up, Whitey.
I think you'll be a credit to our woodwinds.
Bye, Mr. Willet.
All right. Now, Theodore,
let's hear what you can do.
— Right now?
— Right now.
We were, uh, working on "America,"
now, weren't we?
Yes, Mr. Willet.
["America" Out Of Tune]
[Stops]
Well, Beaver, can't you go any further?
— I could, but it wouldn't be "America."
— Well, I-
I see.
I'll learn it, Mr. Willet.
Really, I will.
I can't be in the band, huh?
Well, you see, Theodore,
you and Whitey are the youngest
that came out for the orchestra.
And Whitey's been taking lessons
for six months, so naturally,
he's quite far ahead of you.
Maybe next year.
Oh.
Maybe I could just sit in the band
and pretend like I was playing?
Well, now, that wouldn't be fair either
to you or the other children, now, would it?
I guess not.
Do I have to give back the clarinet?
Well, Theodore, I'll be working
with the others every day after school.
But I-I guess you can keep it for a while,
and you can practice at home.
Thank you, Mr. Willet.
Oh. How'd you do, Beave?
Who, me?
Yeah, you had tryouts today.
Uh, great, Wally.
Just great.
Oh, good.
Hi, Beaver.
Hi, Mom.
Wally's still at school?
Yeah. He had to practice baseball.
Oh, that's right.
Your father's gonna stop by
and watch them play.
Yeah, I seen him there.
Oh?
How come you aren't at school
practicing with the band?
Uh, I think
they let us go early today.
Oh.
Honey, don't spoil your dinner.
Oh, no, Mom.
Mom?
Hmm?
I guess Dad's pretty glad
about Wally making the baseball team, huh?
He certainly is.
And I guess he's kind of glad
about me and the clarinet too.
Oh, he certainly is, Beaver.
Well, you're only in the second grade,
and to be in the school band,
that's quite an accomplishment.
Mmm. Yeah.
And I guess Dad would feel pretty bad...
if Wally wasn't no good
and got thrown off the team?
Yes. Yes, he would.
He'd be quite upset.
I thunk so.
Beaver, Wally hasn't
gotten into any trouble
on the baseball team, has he?
Oh, no, Mom.
With Billy Eehart having the measles,
Wally's just about
the best player in the whole school.
Well, then why all this talk?
I don't know.
I guess I just like to suppose things
that aren't gonna happen.
Hurry up, boys.
You're gonna be late.
So long, Mom.
Here's your lunch.
So long, Dad.
So long, Wally. Say, hey.
You gonna pitch again today?
Yeah, Dad.
My arm feels great.
Swell.
So long Mom. So long Dad.
See you later.
Bye.
Beaver?
Don't forget your clarinet.
I almost forgot it.
Hey, Beave, how you
coming along with the band?
Oh, fine.
My fingers feel great.
Swell.
Bye.
Bye.
Ward, I know you're happy
about Wally and the baseball team,
but, well, I think
you should make a little more fuss
maybe over Beaver and his clarinet.
Well, June, I'm proud as can be
about him being in the band.
After all, he's only
in the second grade.
Look, I'll tell you what. Tonight,
we'll ask him to play for us again.
Oughta show a lot of improvement
after two weeks, huh?
["America" Out Of Tune]
Now, Wally,
I wouldn't laugh at your brother.
I think he's shown
remarkable progress.
Don't you, June?
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
Thank you.
Could I go now?
Certainly.
I’d better go too.
Hey, June, I didn't wanna
say anything to discourage him,
but isn't that the same tune
he played two weeks ago?
Yes, it is.
Maybe that's Mr. Willet's system.
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe when he gets
the whole band together,
it comes out all right.
You think I oughta call him up
and just see how the Beave's doing?
Oh, no, Ward.
I wouldn't do that.
I'd hate him to think
we were like Judy's mother.
Hey, Beave, that junk you just played,
it was the same junk
you played before, wasn't it?
Maybe it was.
All right, Beave.
When did they kick you out of the band?
Two weeks a— Two weeks ago.
And you've been carrying that thing
back and forth just to make it look good?
What a goof!
You can't get away with it,
pretending you're in the band.
They're gonna catch you,
and then you're gonna get in trouble.
Well, if I do get in trouble,
it's all your fault.
— My fault?
—Yeah.
If I had to have a brother,
why did it have to be one
that could play baseball so good?
I, um— I'll get my breakfast
downtown this morning.
Now, why would Wally wanna carry
messy old shoelaces like that in his pocket?
Those are not shoelaces.
I think they're very old worms.
Worms?
Hey, what's this?
I found that in another pocket.
Looks like some sort of a fang.
It's a horse tooth.
Well, now, why would anyone
want a horse tooth?
Oh, I don't know.
I just know I wouldn't trust a kid
who didn't want one.
Ward, look.
Here's a notice from the boys' school.
"Grant Avenue School Band Concert.
7:00 pm. Thursday night."
Hey, that's tonight.
Yes.
Well, I wonder why
the Beaver didn't show it to us.
He's so proud of being in the band.
Ah, he probably just stuck it in his pocket
along with the horse tooth
and forgot about it.
Well, that's funny.
Here it is, the Beaver's big night,
and he doesn't even mention it.
Ain't that just like a kid?
Good—bye, dear.
Have a nice breakfast.
Hey, Beave,
will you tell me somethin'?
What are you doin'?
Puttin' on my blue suit.
What for? You can't go
to the band concert.
You're not in it.
But Mom and Dad think I'm in it.
So you're just gonna put on your blue suit
and walk out of here with Mom and Dad
with a clarinet under your arm?
What else can I do?
Anyway, somethin' good
might happen on the way.
Like what?
Like I might get sick in the car.
Beaver, a guy just can't get sick
when he wants to.
I guess not.
Can you think of anything, Wally?
Well, you couldn't play the clarinet
if you wrecked your fingers.
How could I wreck my fingers?
Well,you could slam 'em
in the door or somethin'.
Wally, help me tie my tie.
How come you're not gettin' dressed?
Aren't you goin'?
No, I don't wanna be there
and watch what happens
when they find out what you did.
You should've told 'em
a long time ago.
But Dad was so proud of you
for gettin' on the baseball team.
I wanted him to have
somethin' to be proud of me for.
Yeah.
Well—
Wally, where you goin'?
Uh, well, I gotta
get some stuff downstairs.
Darling?
What are you so nervous about?
You aren't gonna play tonight.
Well, I certainly am.
I'm gonna be right in there...
straining for every note with him.
[Humming "America" Out Of Tune]
Oh, hi. Where's the Beaver?
You're not dressed.
Well, he'll be right down
in a couple minutes.
But I think there's something
you oughta know.
Well, what?
Well, uh—
Well, the Beaver's not in the band.
What do you mean, he's not in the band?
We're going to hear him play tonight.
Well, Mr. Willet flunked him
out of the band three weeks ago.
Well, he's been taking
his clarinet to school every morning.
I know. He's been hopin' something good
would happen before you found out.
Now, why would he deliberately
try to deceive us like this?
Well, you got such a kick out of me
makin' the baseball team and everything,
he wanted you to like him
for somethin' too.
Oh.
[Door Closes]
I'm all set to go.
Uh— Well, Beaver, um—
Beaver, uh, something's come up,
and your mother and I are not going
to be able to go to the concert.
— Oh?
— We're awfully sorry to disappoint you.
You mean I'm gonna
have to go by myself?
Well, I don't think a fellow your age
should go out alone at night.
Yes, Beaver.
Why don't you go upstairs...
and take your suit off,
and maybe we can all go some other time.
Yeah, maybe we can go some other time.
I don't think Mr. Willet
will really miss me.
Hey, wait up, Beave.
Sure, Wally.
[Sighs]
Oh, Ward, can you imagine what
he's gone through for the last few weeks...
just so you'd still be proud of him?
Yep.
You know something, June?
We'd be a lot better parents...
If we didn't wait
till they did something good
to let 'em know we're proud of 'em.
Every once in a while,
just for no reason at all,
we oughta tell 'em we love them.
I just wanted to remind you boys
to brush your teeth
before you go to bed tonight.
Your mother will be up in a few minutes
to say good night to you.
Okay, Dad. Good night.
Good night, Wally.
Good night, Beave.
Dad?
What is it, Beave?
Thanks.
Well, thanks for what, Beaver?
For pretending you still thunk
I was in the band.
Oh. Well, don't you worry
about it, Beaver.
You'll make it next year.
