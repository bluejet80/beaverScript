Title: Little House on the Prairie (1974â€“1983): Season 1, Episode 16  - Family Quarrel - full transcript

[BELL RINGS]
GO ON. YOU HEARD HER.
GET!
GET!
SIT.
DON'T GO TOO FAR.
[BELL RINGS]
AND ANYWAY, I DON'T
KNOW WHY YOU HAD TO
GET A HUNTING DOG.
[DOG HOWLING]
HUNTING. HA!
ALL THAT DOG
IS GOOD FOR








IS BARKING AND
DIGGING HOLES...
AND MAKING MESSES.
HE'S A GOOD DOG.
NOW, YOU SAW HIS PAPERS.
UH-HUH.
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.
[MUTTERING]
A DOG! WE DON'T
NEED ONE...
[SNEEZES]
OH, I DECLARE!
IF YOU MUST
TAKE TIME OFF FROM
HONEST WORK TO FISH,
I DO WISH YOU WOULD NOT
LEAVE YOUR SMELLY OLD
FISHING PARAPHERNALIA
IN THE STOREROOM!
[DOOR SLAMS]
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE FOOLING WITH
THE COUGH MEDICINE?
IT'S MOSTLY ALCOHOL.
I HAPPEN TO HAVE
A COUGH.








IT'S THE ONLY REASON
YOU DRINK IT.
DEMON RUM.
Nellie: AAH!
Willie: YOU
PUSHED ME FIRST!
GET OUT
OF THAT CANDY!
HUMPH! STINGY!
I AM NOT STINGY.
THEIR TEETH
WILL FALL OUT.
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANT TO HAPPEN?
YOU WANT THEIR
TEETH TO FALL OUT?
YOU MAY EACH HAVE
3 PIECES OF CANDY.
TAKE THEM NICELY
AND GO ON TO SCHOOL.
[BELL RINGS]
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. INGALLS!
GOOD MORNING,
MR. OLESON.
AND HOW ARE YOU
THIS FINE DAY?
WHY, FINE, THANK YOU.
YOURSELF?
FINE, THANK YOU.
MRS. OLESON.
YES.
I HOPE YOU'RE
QUITE WELL.
WELL ENOUGH.
HMM.
THESE EGGS ARE
NOT THE USUAL EGGS
YOU BRING TO US.
YOU DIDN'T, PERHAPS,
SAVE THE GOOD ONES
FOR YOUR OWN USE?
Caroline:
JUST THE OPPOSITE.
AS ALWAYS,
THESE ARE THE BEST.
MM-HMM.
WELL, I CAN'T PAY
THE USUAL PRICE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THESE EGGS ARE NOT
UP TO STANDARD.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THOSE EGGS.
WELL, I THINK I'M
THE JUDGE OF THAT.
JUDGE? YOU'RE NOT
THE JUDGE OF ANYTHING.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
YOU ARE? I'M GOING TO
TELL YOU WHAT YOU ARE.
YOU ARE A MEAN,
NASTY-TEMPERED WOMAN.
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE CALLING MEAN
AND NASTY-TEMPERED!
IT WOULD BE BETTER OFF
FOR THIS WHOLE TOWN
IF YOU WERE
LOCKED UP IN A CAGE
AND FED WITH A STICK.
YOU HAVE MADE LIFE
MISERABLE FOR--
YOU ARE A SPITEFUL
MOUSE!
OH, IS THAT RIGHT?
WELL, LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING...
IT'S ABOUT TIME
I PUT MY FOOT DOWN!
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU
FOUND OUT WHO WEARS
THE PANTS IN THIS FAMILY!
FROM NOW ON, I WILL JUDGE
THE EGGS AROUND HERE!
FINE.
FINE!
YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD
AND JUDGE THEM!
[DOOR SLAMS]
NOW, MRS. INGALLS...
IF YOU WOULD BE KIND
ENOUGH TO TELL ME
HOW MUCH YOUR EGGS
WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH
AT THE REGULAR PRICE.
[LAUGHING]
CHARLES,
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
I KNOW, CAROLINE.
I'M SORRY...
[LAUGHING]
I'M SORRY.
IN SPITE OF
WHAT YOU SAY,
I CAN'T HELP FEELING
THAT I'M AT LEAST
PARTLY RESPONSIBLE.
OH, CAROLINE, THE OLESONS
HAVE BEEN BUILDING UP TO
A FALLING-OUT FOR YEARS.
IT WOULD'VE HAPPENED IF
YOU'D HAVE BEEN MILES AWAY.
SINCE I WAS THERE,
I MIGHT AT LEAST
HAVE PREVENTED IT
OR--
OR STOPPED IT BEFORE
IT WENT TOO FAR.
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A MOUNTAIN OUT OF
A MOLEHILL.
IT'S A FAMILY QUARREL.
THEY'LL BE OVER IT
IN A FEW DAYS.
I'M NOT SO SURE.
OH, CHARLES, REALLY,
IT WAS SO BAD.
I BET IT WAS.
[LAUGHING]
PLEASE JUST TELL ME
ABOUT IT ONE MORE TIME.
SHE TOOK THE WHOLE BASKET
OF EGGS AND JUST DUMPED IT
RIGHT ON HIS HEAD,
AND THEN HE PAID YOU
FOR THEM?
OH, COME ON, PLEASE!
TELL ME...
I DON'T THINK I WILL.
WELL, LET ME GO OUTSIDE
AND THINK ABOUT IT.
[LAUGHING]
[DOOR CLOSES]
GOOD NIGHT,
MOTHER.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT,
MOTHER.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, FATHER.
GOOD NIGHT,
NELLIE.
GOOD NIGHT, PA.
GOOD NIGHT,
WILLIE.
AHEM.
MRS. OLESON,
IF I MIGHT SPEAK
A FEW WORDS...
GO AHEAD, MR. OLESON.
I THINK IT
BEHOOVES US BOTH
TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING
OTHER THAN OURSELVES
IN THIS MATTER.
SUCH AS?
WELL, THE CHILDREN,
FOR INSTANCE.
YES, I THINK THE CHILDREN
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.
AND THE BUSINESS--
OUR STORE. THAT'S
VERY IMPORTANT.
AND I DON'T THINK WE
SHOULD FORGET OUR POSITION
IN THIS COMMUNITY.
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
CONDUCT OURSELVES IN A WAY
THAT PEOPLE WILL LOOK UP
TO US...ADMIRE US.
DON'T YOU AGREE?
I AGREE.
THERE. YOU SEE? I KNEW
WE COULD WORK IT OUT.
WELL...
[SIGHS]
NOTHING
IS IMPOSSIBLE...
IF ONE SETS
ONE'S MIND TO IT.
I'M GLAD IT'S OVER.
AREN'T YOU?
YEAH, I GUESS SO.
I KNOW I SAID
SOME THINGS THAT
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID...
EVEN IF THEY WERE TRUE.
TRUE?
WELL, YOU CAN BE A--
A PICKY WOMAN
IF THE MOOD TAKES YOU.
I MEAN, YOU CAN
GET PRETTY MEAN WITH
YOUR NAGGING, AT TIMES.
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT I MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHING TO NAG ABOUT?
WELL, NO, NOT REALLY.
I MEAN, YOU LIKE TO
NAG A MAN, AND THAT'S
THE TRUTH OF IT.
NOW, THAT IS NOT TRUE.
YES, IT IS.
YOU'RE A NAG.
YOU ARE A CHEAP
EXCUSE FOR A MAN.
YOU'RE A LAZY
AND COWARDLY,
SNIVELING,
STUBBORN JACKASS!
AND FROM NOW ON,
YOU CAN JUST SEW
YOUR OWN SHIRTS!
CHARLES?
MM?
WOULD YOU MIND IF
I ASKED MRS. OLESON
TO LET NELLIE AND WILLIE
SPEND A FEW DAYS
WITH US?
I DON'T MIND.
JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT GOOD
IT'S GOING TO DO.
WELL, SOMETIMES
IT HELPS JUST TO
SPEND A LITTLE TIME
ALONE TOGETHER.
WHATEVER YOU THINK.
I'LL ASK HER TOMORROW.
GOOD NIGHT, CHARLES.
[KISS]
GOOD NIGHT.
[YAWN]
[SIGHING]
ARE YOU GOING TO
BRING EGGS
INTO MRS. OLESON'S
TOMORROW?
OF COURSE.
I ALWAYS DO.
[LAUGHS]
WELL, YOU BETTER
HARD-BOIL.
[LAUGHS]
GOOD NIGHT.
[LAUGHS]
GOOD NIGHT, CHARLES.
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING,
MR. OLESON.
MARY, WAIT FOR ME!
YOU PROMISED.
WELL, HURRY UP!
WAIT!
PA, GUESS WHAT?
MR. OLESON DOESN'T LIVE
AT HOME ANYMORE.
HE MOVED OUT!
TO THE HOTEL.
NELLIE DOESN'T HAVE
A FATHER ANYMORE.
HOLD ON.
HOLD ON A MINUTE.
ARE YOU TELLING ME
MR. OLESON MOVED TO THE HOTEL
BAG AND BAGGAGE.
HE SURE DID.
BAG, BAGGAGE,
AND DOG.
GO ON UPSTAIRS.
GET YOUR COATS OFF.
START YOUR HOMEWORK.
YES, PA.
OH, CHARLES,
THIS IS TERRIBLE.
A FAMILY BROKEN APART
LIKE THAT.
I WISH THERE WAS
SOMETHING WE COULD DO.
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.
HE ONLY MOVED
100 YARDS AWAY.
WALNUT GROVE
IS A SMALL TOWN.
NO PLACE TO GO
BUT HOME.
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.
GOT TO GET BACK
TO WORK.
[DOOR CLOSES]
MORNING, NELS.
LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER NICE DAY.
COULD BE BETTER.
[KNOCKING]
[BELL RINGS]
[BELL RINGS]
[BELL RINGS]
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. FOSTER.
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. OLESON.
GOOD MORNING,
MR. INGALLS.
MRS. FOSTER.
NELS, HOW'RE YOU DOING?
OH...ALL RIGHT,
I GUESS.
I HOPE SOME OF THOSE
PEOPLE OUT THERE
BUY SOMETHING.
OH, MOST OF THEM
COME TO LOOK.
I'M A CLOWN, CHARLES.
AW, COME ON. YOU'RE
A MAN WITH A PROBLEM.
WE ALL KNOW THAT.
YEAH.
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.
JUST TAKE
A LITTLE TIME.
YEAH. I SURE HOPE SO.
ANYWAY, HOW ARE YOU
THIS MORNING, CARRIE?
HMM?
OOH, I GOT
BAD NEWS FOR YOU.
THEY BACK-ORDERED
THAT CULTIVATOR ON ME.
GOING TO TAKE
ANOTHER WEEK BEFORE
I CAN MAKE DELIVERY.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M NOT IN ANY HURRY.
COME OVER HERE!
LET ME SEE HOW MUCH
YOU'VE GROWN.
OOH! ISN'T SHE
A BIG GIRL!
THAT'LL BE 5 CENTS,
MRS. INGALLS.
OH, IT'S VERY NICE.
AND VERY
REASONABLE, TOO.
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
TOO HARD.
I WAS WONDERING IF
MAYBE NELLIE
AND WILLIE
COULD COME OUT
AND STAY WITH US FOR
A DAY OR SO TO...
TO GIVE YOU
A CHANCE...UMM...
TO CATCH
YOUR BREATH.
OH...
WELL...
REALLY...
NO, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, MRS. INGALLS.
I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL.
AND THANK YOU VERY--
MRS. FOSTER,
MAY I HELP YOU?
YES, I DO BELIEVE
3 YARDS
WILL BE ENOUGH
FOR MY BONNET.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT
WOULD BE VERY LOVELY ON?
YES, MRS. FOSTER.
[BELL RINGS]
DID YOUR CULTIVATOR COME?
NO, IT'S
BACK-ORDERED.
NELS SAID IT'D BE
ANOTHER WEEK OR TWO.
DID YOU ASK
MRS. OLESON IF
NELLIE AND WILLIE
COULD COME OUT
TO THE HOUSE?
I ASKED HER.
SHE ALMOST SAID YES.
SHE'S TIRED AND I THINK
SHE'S LONELY.
BUT SHE JUST WON'T
GIVE IN.
NEITHER WILL NELS.
UP YOU GO,
YOUNG LADY.
Congregation:
* ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS
* MARCHING AS TO WAR
* WITH THE CROSS OF JESUS
* GOING ON BEFORE
* CHRIST, THE ROYAL MASTER
* LEADS AGAINST THE FOE
* FORWARD INTO BATTLE
* SEE HIS BANNERS GO
* ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS
* MARCHING AS TO WAR
* WITH THE CROSS OF JESUS
* GOING ON BEFORE
WELL...
I MUST SAY AMEN
TO YOUR SINGING
THIS MORNING.
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
IN BETTER VOICE.
AND I'D LIKE
TO THANK YOU ALL
FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE,
YOUR ATTENTION...
AND YOUR
CONTRIBUTION.
MAY GOD GO
WITH EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF YOU.
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,
I WON'T BE AT
THE DOOR WHEN YOU
LEAVE THIS MORNING,
BUT I'D LIKE
TO WISH YOU ALL
A VERY PLEASANT DAY.
Man:
SAME TO YOU, REVEREND.
NOW, I'M GOING TO ASK
BOTH OF YOU TO TAKE
AN AISLE SEAT, PLEASE.
THERE'S NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT. I'LL
STAY BETWEEN YOU.
NOW,
ISN'T THAT BETTER?
I'D LIKE TO THANK
BOTH OF YOU FOR
HONORING MY NOTE
AND REMAINING AFTER
SERVICES AS I ASKED.
AS A SERVANT OF GOD
AND YOUR SPIRITUAL
ADVISOR,
I FELT
IT WAS MY DUTY
TO DO EVERYTHING
WITHIN MY POWER
TO RESTORE HAPPINESS
TO YOUR HOME.
DO YOU AGREE?
NOW, WHAT I'M GOING
TO ASK YOU TO DO
IS TO THINK CAREFULLY
ABOUT WHAT YOU HAD...
AND WHAT YOU STAND
TO LOSE.
NOW, YOU'VE BOTH HAD
MORE THAN A DOZEN GOOD
YEARS OF MARRIAGE.
YOU HAVE A HOME...
A BUSINESS...
AND A HIGHLY RESPECTED
PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY.
AND I KNOW YOU HAVE
TWO CHILDREN...
THAT YOU LOVE VERY MUCH.
GOD WANTS YOU
TO LOVE EACH OTHER...
TO CHERISH EACH OTHER...
TO HONOR AND OB--
TO HONOR EACH OTHER.
NOW, YOU PROMISED
HIM YOU WOULD
ON YOUR WEDDING DAY,
REMEMBER?
NOW, I'M GOING TO ASK
YOU BOTH TO RISE.
NOW FACE EACH OTHER.
REACH OUT
TO EACH OTHER.
CLASP EACH
OTHER'S HANDS.
NOW, THE ONE WHO
STANDS BEFORE
EACH OF YOU...
IS THE SAME ONE
THAT YOU PROMISED
TO TAKE FOR BETTER,
FOR WORSE...
THINK ON THAT
A MOMENT.
YOU DISGRACED ME
BEFORE THE WHOLE TOWN,
AND I WANT NOTHING LESS
THAN A PUBLIC APOLOGY.
I DISGRACED YOU?
YOU NAGGING,
PETTY WOMAN!
YOU DISGRACED ME!
THERE HE GOES AGAIN--
CALLING ME BY THOSE
RIDICULOUS NAMES!
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH!
EVEN IN CHURCH,
YOU ARE A STUBBORN,
SNIVELING--
--YOUR CONSTANT
PICKING AND NAGGING
DAY AND NIGHT!
PLEASE! THERE MUST
BE FORGIVENESS!
FORGIVENESS?!
DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT FORGIVENESS
UNTIL YOU'VE LIVED
WITH A WOMAN LIKE THAT!
CHILDREN.
AH.
COME ON, ALFIE.
HEEL!
I PROMISED THIS ORDER
FOR 4:00. HURRY IT UP,
WILL YOU, JOE?
IF I'M A HEALER
OF BODIES,
AND I THINK WE
CAN ACCEPT THE FACT
THAT I AM A HEALER
OF SOME SKILL
AND REPUTE...
JA, SURE.
WELL, THEN IT
FOLLOWS LOGICALLY
THAT I'M QUALIFIED
TO HEAL OTHER AILMENTS
OF MAN, AS WELL...
SUCH AS
DOMESTIC TROUBLES...
UH...BROKEN MARRIAGES
AND THE LIKE.
IT DOES?
A GOOD DOCTOR IS
A GOOD PSYCHOLOGIST
FIRST AND FOREMOST.
THAT IS
A WELL-KNOWN FACT.
IT IS, HUH?
NOW, WE'VE GOT TO HELP
THE OLESONS, AGREED?
JA, I AGREE.
AND IN ORDER TO HELP
THE OLESONS,
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE ONE
OR THE OTHER OF THEM
GIVE UP THE FIGHT.
AGREED?
JA, SURE, SURE.
I--I AGREE,
BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO MAKE ONE OF THEM
QUIT FIGHTING?
AHA!
NOW, THAT'S WHERE
PSYCHOLOGY COMES IN.
ANSWER ME
A QUESTION...
YEAH.
A MAN DOESN'T WORRY
ABOUT LOSING SOMETHING
THAT NOBODY ELSE WANTS,
DOES HE?
WHY SHOULD HE WORRY?
WHY INDEED.
BUT IF THAT MAN THINKS
THAT ANOTHER MAN
IS ABOUT TO RUN OFF
WITH SOMETHING
THAT HAS BELONGED
TO HIM ALWAYS,
ABSOLUTELY...
THEN THAT MAN IS GOING
TO RISE UP AND DECLARE
HIS OWNERSHIP
IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS,
WON'T HE?
RIGHT.
BUT, UH...
WHO IS GOING TO RUN OFF
WITH MRS. OLESON?
YOU.
WHO?
YOU.
NOW--NOW WAIT
JUST A MINUTE.
NOW, ALL YOU'RE
GOING TO DO IS
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE RUNNING OFF
WITH MRS. OLESON.
NOW, THAT'S ALL.
JUST MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE IT.
NEJ DA!
NEJ DA!
NO! I AIN'T GOING TO DO
NO FOOL THING LIKE THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT,
I TRIED MY BEST.
JUST DON'T COME
CRYING TO ME.
WHY SHOULD I CRY?
HUH?
COME ON! TELL ME!
WHY?
WHAT DO I GOT
TO CRY ABOUT?
TELL ME.
WHAT--WHAT DO I GOT
TO CRY ABOUT?
GO ON.
ALL RIGHT.
THE OLESONS WILL CLOSE
THEIR STORE, HMM?
MM-HMM.
ALL BILLS WILL
BECOME DUE AND
PAYABLE AT ONCE.
PEOPLE WILL PAY
WHATEVER THEY CAN.
CASH WILL VANISH.
THERE WON'T BE
ANY MONEY LEFT
FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION,
LUMBER...
OH, I CAN MOVE
MY PRACTICE,
BUT, UH...
YOU...CAN'T...
MOVE...YOUR...MILL.
DO YOU THINK
THAT WILL HAPPEN?
I'M SURE OF IT.
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY...
NO.
WHAT DO THEY SAY?
LIFE IS NO
BED OF ROSES.
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
I FEEL FOOLISH.
YOU LOOK FINE,
MY FRIEND. FINE.
NOW, DON'T WORRY.
NELS IS OUT AT
THE BIRCH PLACE
THIS AFTERNOON,
AND THE COAST IS CLEAR.
REMEMBER,
YOU'RE OUR LAST HOPE.
[BELL RINGS]
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THOSE APPLES?
THEY'RE GOOD.
MMM.
GOT A SEEDLING
ORDERED.
HAVE OUR OWN TREE
NEXT YEAR.
WON'T HAVE TO DEPEND
ON THE JOHNSONS
FOR PIES
AND APPLE SAUCE.
SOME OF THESE GOT
WORMS IN 'EM.
WORMS WON'T
HURT YOU.
WHOLE WORMS WON'T,
BUT I DON'T LIKE
THE HALF-WORMS.
...YOU KNOW YOU ATE
THE OTHER HALF.
WELL, WORMS
MUST BE PRETTY
NOURISHING
BIRDS LIVE
ON THEM.
ICK.
Laura: HI, MA!
HI, MA.
HMM.
MEN.
HONEST
TO GOODNESS!
UH, GIRLS...I WANT YOU
TO TAKE IN THE WASH...
AND FOLD IT CAREFULLY.
YES, MA.
YES, MA.
YOU BETTER
WASH THAT APPLE
OFF YOUR HANDS.
[SIGHS]
YOU WERE SAYING
SOMETHING ABOUT MEN.
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN I THINK MEN
ARE THE MOST SENSELESS
CREATURES IN THE WORLD.
THANK YOU.
PRESENT COMPANY
EXCEPTED, OF COURSE.
WHAT DID ALL THE REST
OF THESE MEN DO TO
UPSET YOU SO MUCH?
SOMEONE--I THINK
IT WAS DR. BAKER--
TALKED MR. HANSON INTO
MAKING AN ATTEMPT AT
COURTING HARRIET OLESON.
WHAT?
I SUPPOSE TO MAKE
NELS OLESON SO JEALOUS
HE'D COME RUNNING
BACK AND TAKE HER
IN HIS ARMS.
WELL, WHAT DID MRS. OLESON
THINK ABOUT THAT?
WHAT ANY DECENT WOMAN
WOULD THINK.
SHE WAS SHOCKED.
SHE WAS SO SHOCKED,
SHE--
SHE...
SHE WHAT?
SHE THREW A WHOLE
SCOOP OF FLOUR ON HIM.
OH, SHE OUT OF EGGS?
CHARLES,
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
NO, I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU
THE WORST OF IT.
YOU SEE, MRS. KENNEDY
AND MRS. WHITWORTH
AND I WERE THERE.
WE HAD BEEN TRYING
TO TALK HARRIET
INTO MAKING UP
HER QUARREL WITH NELS,
AND WE WERE THAT CLOSE.
WE TRIED TO
PASS IT OFF AS A JOKE,
BUT IT'S NO USE.
HARRIET IS TAKING
HER CHILDREN AND
LEAVING WALNUT GROVE.
SHE'S GOING BACK EAST
FOR GOOD.
LAURA?
YEAH?
DID YOU SEE HOW SAD
NELLIE LOOKED TODAY?
KIND OF.
[BLOWS OUT LAMP]
SOME OF THE GIRLS
WERE TEASING HER
ABOUT HER MA AND PA.
I WANTED TO SAY
SOMETHING TO HER TO
MAKE HER FEEL BETTER.
I JUST COULDN'T
THINK OF ANYTHING.
DID WILLIE SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU?
YEAH...
"SHUT UP,"
LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES.
OH.
WELL,
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT.
THEN WHY DID
HE SAY IT?
WELL, PA SAYS PEOPLE
SAY BAD THINGS
THEY DON'T MEAN
BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT HAPPY INSIDE.
WILLIE MUST BE
AWFUL UNHAPPY INSIDE.
LET'S TRY TO CHEER
HIM UP TOMORROW.
DO I HAVE TO?
LAURA INGALLS!
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD.
AND IF I SAY ONE
BAD THING TO WILLIE,
THAT JUST MEANS
I'M UNHAPPY INSIDE.
GOOD NIGHT.
[BELL RINGS]
NELLIE! WILLIE!
ARE YOU REALLY
GOING TO MOVE AWAY?
THAT'S WHAT
MOTHER SAYS.
AND SHE MEANS IT.
I WISH YOU
DIDN'T HAVE TO.
SO DO I.
MAYBE WE'VE QUARRELED
ONCE IN A WHILE,
BUT WE'VE BEEN
GOOD FRIENDS...
HAVEN'T WE?
I DON'T HAVE ANY
BETTER FRIENDS.
I NEVER QUARRELED.
YOU DID SO.
I DID NOT!
YOU DID SO!
BUT IT NEVER
BOTHERED ME.
Mary: WE'RE GOING
TO MISS YOU BOTH.
WE COULD WRITE LETTERS.
I'LL WRITE TO YOU
IF YOU WANT ME TO.
OF COURSE
WE WANT YOU TO.
WE'LL ANSWER EVERY ONE,
WON'T WE, LAURA?
I SUPPOSE.
COURSE WE WILL.
THEN IT WON'T
SEEM LIKE WE'RE
SO FAR APART.
WE'RE GOING TO MISS
YOU AND MISS BEADLE
AND ALL THE KIDS.
CAN I BE EXCUSED?
[SCOFFS] HONEY,
YOU DIDN'T
EAT ANYTHING.
I'M NOT HUNGRY.
ME NEITHER.
COULD I BE
EXCUSED, TOO?
[SIGH] ALL RIGHT.
[SIGH]
Hanson: I JUST CAN'T
CHARGE YOU FOR IT, NELS.
WELL, LARS,
SHE'S GOT TO HAVE IT.
IT'S THE ONLY
GOOD TRUNK IN TOWN.
AND SHE CAN'T COME IN
HERE HERSELF AFTER...
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED.
YEAH, WELL, THAT IS JUST
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT--
WHAT HAPPENED.
I--I MADE SUCH A FOOL.
IF--IF I DIDN'T DID
WHAT I DID,
SHE WOULDN'T
BE LEAVING TOWN.
NO, NO, NO. THAT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH
HER LEAVING TOWN.
SHE'D GO ANYHOW.
IT WOULD--
IT'S ALL OVER
BETWEEN US.
WELL, NAME A PRICE,
LARS. IT'S--IT'S
A GOOD TRUNK.
WELL...TAKE IT.
PLEASE. A GIFT.
CONFOUND IT,
LARS, NOW--
$2.00. HERE.
NOW, TAKE IT.
Charles: I WANT YOU
TO KEEP THIS COAT
BUTTONED UP ALL THE TIME
SO YOU STAY WARM,
ALL RIGHT?
OK, OFF WE GO.
DON'T TAKE TOO LONG.
BYE, GIRLS.
BYE, MOMMY.
BE SURE TO HOLD HANDS
WHEN YOU'RE CROSSING
THE CREEK.
WE WILL, PA.
WELL, I BETTER
GET STARTED.
THIS WILL BE
MY LAST VISIT
WITH HARRIET OLESON.
NOW THAT THE GIRLS
ARE GONE,
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THAT.
THE OLESONS, I MEAN.
I'VE BEEN GIVING IT
SOME THOUGHT.
TELL ME WHAT YOU
THINK ABOUT IT.
NOW, THE OLESONS
WERE PRETTY HAPPY
WITH THEIR MARRIAGE
THE WAY IT WAS
FOR A LONG TIME,
WEREN'T THEY?
14 YEARS.
WHICH MEANS
THAT NELS MUST
HAVE BEEN HAPPY
WITH THE WAY
THINGS WERE...
WITH HIS WIFE BEING
THE BOSS, KIND OF
RUNNING THINGS.
EVEN NAGGING HIM
A LITTLE.
JUST SO LONG AS
SHE GAVE IN TO HIM
ONCE IN A WHILE.
RIGHT...SO HE COULD
KEEP HIS PRIDE INTACT.
I DON'T THINK THIS
LAST FIGHT THEY HAD
WAS ANY DIFFERENT THAN
A LOT OF OTHER FIGHTS,
EXCEPT THAT
SHE WENT TOO FAR,
AND SHE DID IT
IN FRONT OF WITNESSES.
ONE WITNESS. ME.
RIGHT. THAT'S WHY
I DON'T THINK THE BREAK
IS THAT SERIOUS.
I THINK THERE'S GOT TO
BE A WAY TO HEAL IT, AND
I THINK WE SHOULD TRY.
GOODNESS KNOWS
I'LL DO ANYTHING I CAN.
ALL RIGHT, THEN
LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.
OHH.
WHY, IT'S...BEAUTIFUL.
UH, CAROLINE.
MMM...
IT--IT TOOK HOURS
AND HOURS TO MAKE, I KNOW.
[LAUGHS]
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.
[LAUGHS]
WE'VE HAD OUR...
DIFFICULT MOMENTS,
I KNOW.
AND THEN THIS
LITTLE KINDNESS...
A GOING-AWAY PRESENT.
WELL...
[SIGHS]
IT'S VERY NICE...
I'M SURE.
AND THANK YOU.
THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES!
OH, YES!
BUT LET'S FORGET
ALL THAT NOW.
THANK YOU.
HERE...
LET ME HELP YOU.
OH, THANK YOU.
WELL...
THERE'S ONLY
ONE MORE DAY OF THIS,
THANK GOODNESS.
I KNOW IT HASN'T
BEEN EASY,
BUT I CAN'T HELP
FEELING THAT YOU'RE
MAKING A WISE DECISION.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LEAVING MR. OLESON.
IT WAS BOUND TO COME...
AND BETTER SOONER
THAN LATER.
WE ALL SYMPATHIZE
WITH YOU SO MUCH.
WELL--
OH, MY! WHY, I DIDN'T
KNOW THAT ANYBODY EVEN
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
OH, YES.
WE DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY
ANYTHING, OF COURSE,
BUT...
[CLEARS THROAT]
WELL, MR. OLESON HASN'T
EXACTLY BEEN AN IDEAL
HUSBAND, HAS HE?
OH!
[LAUGHING]
OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA!
HMM...YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW MUCH WE KNEW.
REALLY?
SORT OF MOUSY-LIKE
ONE MINUTE AND
A BULLY THE NEXT.
YES.
YELLING AND SHOUTING.
REALLY, NOT THE KIND
OF MAN ONE WOULD WANT
AS A FATHER FOR
SENSITIVE CHILDREN.
AND CERTAINLY NOT
A GOOD BUSINESSMAN.
OH, WE ALL KNEW WHO HAD
THE HEAD FOR BUSINESS
IN THE FAMILY.
OH, WELL...I DO HAVE
A KNACK OF SORTS.
HUNTING AND FISHING
WHEN HE SHOULD BE
WORKING.
NOW, A LITTLE
OF THAT IS MORE
THAN A WOMAN NEEDS.
YES.
AND MESSY AROUND
THE HOUSE, I UNDERSTAND.
OH, YES.
MUDDY BOOTS
ON CLEAN FLOORS.
AND SMELLY
FISHING CLOTHES. UGH!
[LAUGHS]
I REMEMBER HOW HE
USED TO LOOK WHEN HE
CAME IN FROM HUNTING.
DISREPUTABLE.
THAT SILLY SMILE
ON HIS FACE...
COUPLE OF DUCKS
DRIPPING MUD...
LOOKING AS THOUGH
HE THOUGHT HE'D DONE
SOMETHING WONDERFUL,
WHEN ALL HE'D DONE
WAS MAKE WORK.
WELL, I THINK A MAN
SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE FUN,
AND I DO KNOW THAT
HE ENJOYED GETTING OUT.
AND...AS FOR BEING
A BAD FATHER, ACTUALLY...
WELL, HE WAS VERY FOND
OF THE CHILDREN, REALLY.
OH?
OH, YES, YES.
OH, MESSY...
WELL, I SUPPOSE
ALL MEN ARE.
BUT A...
A BUSINESSMAN, NOW...
WELL, HE COULD
SURPRISE YOU AT TIMES.
[LAUGHING]
I REMEMBER...
[LAUGHING]
...A BARGAIN THAT HE MADE
ON CHINAWARE ONCE.
[LAUGHING]
OH, THAT MAN'S FACE...
WHEN WE WALKED
OUT OF THAT--
[LAUGHING]
I EXPECT YOU'RE
PRETTY RELIEVED NOW
THAT IT'S OVER, HUH?
YEAH.
SHE LEAVES TOMORROW,
RIGHT?
YEP.
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
IT'S BEEN ROUGH,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.
BUT IT'LL ALL
BE OVER SOON.
KIND OF LIKE GETTING
OUT OF JAIL, HUH?
YEAH!
WELL, A MAN CAN
PUT UP WITH AN AWFUL
LOT IN THIS LIFE,
BUT A MEAN,
NAGGING WIFE...
THAT'S TOO MUCH.
WAY TOO MUCH.
A WOMAN'S GOT
TO KNOW HER PLACE.
YOUR WIFE DIDN'T,
IF YOU DON'T MIND
MY SAYING SO.
NO, NO. IT'S TRUE.
YOU KNOW, YOU SPEND
YOUR WHOLE LIFE
BEING GOOD TO THEM,
TRYING TO BE NICE...
AND THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE.
IT'S THE OLD SAYING,
"GIVE THEM AN INCH,"
YOU KNOW.
EVERYBODY IN TOWN
KNEW YOUR WIFE
WAS TAKING A MILE.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IN A FEW MONTHS
IF SHE HADN'T DRIVEN OFF
ALL THE TRADE.
NOT MUCH OF
A BUSINESSWOMAN.
OH, NOW...
I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER I'D GO AS
FAR AS TO SAY THAT.
I MEAN, ABOUT BEING
A BUSINESSWOMAN.
SHE COULD
SURPRISE YOU.
REALLY?
VERY SHARP
WITH FIGURES.
COULD DO A 3-COLUMN
SUM IN HER HEAD.
I'VE SEEN HER DO IT.
KIND OF PROUD OF HER.
OH...
HE...
COULD SHOUT AND BULLY.
BUT HE DIDN'T
VERY OFTEN...
IF I WERE TO
BE FAIR ABOUT IT.
AND THEN...
MAYBE HE HAD REASON.
NOW, I'M NOT THE EASIEST
PERSON IN THE WORLD
TO GET ALONG WITH.
AT TIMES I GET A BIT,
UM...PERSNICKETY.
BUT AS FOR
BEING A MOUSE, I...
I DON'T KNOW, I...
I SUPPOSE THAT...
KINDNESS AND...
GENTLENESS IN A--
IN A MAN...
COULD BE MISTAKEN
FOR WEAKNESS.
I GUESS SHE MADE
A FEW ENEMIES.
BUT SHE MADE A LOT
OF FRIENDS, TOO.
YOU KNOW, A LOT
OF THAT CRANKINESS
IS JUST TO COVER UP
A SOFT HEART.
YOU KNOW THAT
WHEN YOU KNOW HER
AS WELL AS I DO.
SHE'S A VERY KIND
PERSON, REALLY.
BUT SHE DID NAG YOU,
THOUGH.
YES, YES.
BUT I'M NOT THE EASIEST
PERSON IN THE WORLD
TO GET ALONG WITH.
WELL, I'M NOT NEAT AND
ORDERLY, FOR INSTANCE.
[LAUGHS]
I REMEMBER ONE TIME
I'D BEEN DUCK HUNTING,
AND I HAD
A BOOTFUL OF WATER.
I PULLED THE BOOT OFF,
AND ALL THIS MUDDY
WATER WENT ALL OVER
HER CLEAN FLOOR.
OH...SHE LIKE TO TORE
THE HIDE RIGHT OFF ME!
YEAH...SHE SURE
CAN GET MAD.
CHARLES...
WHAT IN LIFE
GOT INTO ME?
I LOVE THAT WOMAN.
I KNOW.
WELL, I CAN'T
LET HER GO.
WHY DON'T YOU GO ON
OVER THERE AND TELL HER?
BY GOLLY, I WILL.
OH...OH,
I'M A SIGHT!
NO, NO,
YOU LOOK FINE.
[BELL RINGS]
HARRIET, I'VE BEEN
A DARN FOOL.
WHY...NELS.
I'VE LET OUR ARGUMENT
GO ON AND ON AND ON, AND...
AND ALL THE WHILE,
I'VE LOVED YOU
AS MUCH AS THE DAY
I MARRIED YOU...
MAYBE EVEN MORE.
WELL, HAVEN'T YOU
GOT ANYTHING TO SAY?
I...I WAS JUST
ON MY WAY TO FIND YOU
TO TELL YOU EXACTLY
THE SAME THING.
YOU WERE?
OH, I LOVE YOU, NELS.
[CRYING]
WELL, I'LL JUST
BE A MINUTE.
ALL RIGHT.
AND WE CAN TURN
THE WAGON AROUND.
[BELL RINGS]
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. INGALLS.
MORNING,
MRS. OLESON.
MR. OLESON.
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. INGALLS.
WELL, NOW, THOSE
ARE FINE EGGS.
THEY DESERVE
TOP PRICE.
NELS, DEAR...
I'LL BE THE JUDGE
OF THAT, HMM?
NOW, HOW MANY,
MRS. INGALLS?
TWO DOZEN.
ALL RIGHT.
SAME PRICE AS USUAL.
BUT, DEAR, WE RAISED
THE PRICE THAT WE'RE
SELLING THEM FOR.
PLEASE, DEAR.
BUT WE DID
RAISE THE PRICE.
PLEASE, DEAR.
WOULD YOU KINDLY TEND
TO YOUR OWN AFFAIRS?
ANYTHING THAT HAS
TO DO WITH THE STORE
IS MY AFFAIR,
INCLUDING
THE PRICE OF EGGS.
OH? AND JUST WHEN
DID THAT START?
IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN THAT WAY,
AND YOU KNOW IT.
OH, NO, IT HASN'T.
YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT
ONE EGG SINCE
THE STORE OPENED,
NOR AN INCH OF YARD GOODS,
NOR A SPOOL OF THREAD...
WELL, I COULD BUY
YARD GOODS A LOT BETTER
THAN YOU'VE EVER DONE IT.
OH, YOU COULD,
COULD YOU?
AND WHAT ABOUT THE TIME
YOU BOUGHT THE PLOWS
FOR 4 TIMES THE PRICE,
AND THEY DIDN'T SELL,
DID THEY?
I SOLD THEM.
AT A LOSS.
AT A PROFIT! AND YOU
WOULD KNOW THAT IF YOU
LOOKED IN THE BOOK!
I LOOKED IN THE BOOK!
AND WHO CAN READ
THOSE SPIDER TRACKS
THAT YOU CALL FIGURES!
SPIDER TRACKS?!
WHY, I WON PRIZES
IN PENMANSHIP!
PRIZES? YOU WON
A PRIZE, AND...
JUST CREDIT MY ACCOUNT.
NOW YOU'RE
CALLING ME A DUNCE?
GOOD-BYE.
* RIDE LIKE A GENTLEMAN,
RIDE LIKE A GENTLEMAN *
* RIDE LIKE A GENTLEMAN,
RIDE LIKE A GENTLEMAN *
WELL, HOW'S
THE LOVE BIRDS
THIS MORNING?
BACK TO NORMAL,
CHARLES.
BACK TO NORMAL.
YEAH...THAT'S WHAT
I WANTED TO HEAR.
