and you're gonna be Adam.
[groans]
And Jessica's gonna be Eve, and
so that's the surprise, Morty.
No, you can't!
J-Jessica doesn't
even know I exist.
But -- but -- but
forget about that,
because you can't
blow up humanity.
I-I get what you're trying
to say, M-Morty.
Listen, I'm not --
You don't --
Y-y-you don't got to worry about
me trying to fool around with --
With Jessica or mess around
with Jessica or anything.








I'm -- I'm not that
kind of guy, Morty.
What are you talking
about, Rick?
You -- you -- you don't
have to worry about me getting
with Jessica or anything.
She -- she -- she -- she --
She's all for you, Morty.
I don't care
about Jessica!
You know what, Morty?
You're right.
Let's forget the
girl all together.
She -- she's probably nothing
but trouble, anyways.
SHIP:
Arming Neutrino bomb.
That's it --
That's it, Rick.
I'm taking the wheel.
Get off of me, Morty!
I'm taking charge of
this situation, buddy.








What's gotten into you?
I'm -- I'm -- I'm --
I'm not gonna stand around
like some sort of dumb...
What are you, crazy?
Person and just let
you blow up the whole world.
All right, all right.
I'll -- I'll land.
I'll land. I'll land.
I'll land the thing.
I'll land the thing.
Big tough guy all of a sudden.
We'll park it right here, Morty.
Right here on the s-side
of the r-road here.
Oh, thank God.
You know what?
That was all a test, Morty.
Just an elaborate test
to make you more assertive.
It was?
Sure. Why not?
I don't -- I don't know.
You -- you know what, Mo--

Um...
[ beeping increases]
I see there's a new episode of
that singing show tonight.
Who do you guys think is
gonna be the best singer?
Oh, my God.
His head is in his food.
I'm going to puke.
Morty, are you getting sick?
I told you not to practice-kiss
the living-room pillow.
The dog sleeps on it.
